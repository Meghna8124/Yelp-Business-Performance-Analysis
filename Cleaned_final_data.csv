What got last week 34 that. My husband I ordering combo jerk chicken, jade red chicken, chicken fried rice black beans ever since location opened Chandler. And always satisfied.

They also used give daughter small cup rice little bit plain chicken. time, I asked little kiddie cup, gave size cup, empty... The one thing give generously still big huge sugar cookies. Unfortunately, ever finish half those. Id rather get free cup rice daughter, three big sugar cookies. If ever go back, ill ask theyll me.

I eaten bunch love it. The jerk rice killer. someone totally dissed saying spice pepper...umm...no You really try see. The combinations I found favorite jade red chicken sweet roasted pork quesadilla. Those combinations flavors would never expect good. In opinion could make changes making 10 times money. 1. Get normal freakin menu. You cant go place say I number six large soft drink. None us want work much thinking order food. They want sample demonstrations usually time since NOBODY GOES THERE. I wish would even guts pilot simplified menuI think would shocked much business would get. 2 Get conventional items menu i.e. Nachos chips salsa something good snacky kind food. 3 Come signature item two give original names rather allmenuitemsareequal approach. It worth checking I enjoy eating still. Its bit cafeteriaindustrial warehouseish much check statue panda sombrero.

30,l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"Chino Bandito far one favorite places eat. I seriously go way make stop there. I eating Chinos 9 years I doubt I ever stop going! They two locations valley I times I recall. Both excellent options first visit Chinos. If want get lunch I would recommend get early place gets crowded lunch. Chinos loyal fans somewhat complicated system ordering. The best part staff always helpful attentive. They walk ordering process many times desire. The portions huge cost isnt bad either. Plan spend 8 10 bucks per person probably leftovers. The staff exceptionally helpful, take time give sample every single item menu ever spend dime! I dont know restaurant world gives much free food samples. I personally recommend black beans porkfried rice paired jade red chicken quesadilla jen red pork burrito. This usual Chinos although I tried nearly every side entre menu."

And go wrong get snicker doodle cookies food Steer clear youre looking anything even slightly resembling authentic Chinese Mexican, thats expecting place called Chino Bandito Bandito Panda chowing pair chopsticks shouldnt allowed choose eat anyway."
35,l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"Love place, one husband mine time favorites. Its casual really fun unique food packs great fusion flavor. They allow newbies try samples, would well bringing people try it. .. combo deals way go."
36,EAs61Wm1O6tLjCs8t2eP-Q,"It sincere trepidation I went dinner Wok Wei night. Its I heard bad things place; all. But I afraid I might actually LIKE ... youve lived long enough, know turnover restaurants apparently cursed spot quick often. The last restaurant BBQ place I even chance try it, went! As turns out, food indeed worth effort. The place incredibly clean pleasing eye though lowhanging lamps booths give slight feeling interrogated. Though place small, 18 booths tables dont give feeling crammed in. The wait staff friendly helpful, though communication problems due linguistic comprehension problems. As probably already know, Chinese restaurants combination plates, really good deal you, least one person, tastes food. Thankfully, restaurant taken concept offering combination plates ALL entrees date stands Friday night youre obnoxious get date first place, dont break bank ordering la carte. The egg rolls quite good large greasy all, sort unusual egg rolls. The crab puffs like atinybitofPhiladelphiaCreamCheesebetweenlargefriednoodles, still good. The hot n sour soup good, nothing like Ive ever before. I ordered Mongolian Beef, which, me, bit salty; however, I never use salt home, Im pretty sensitive used. Probably, average American, isnt really salty all. The combo plate comes unhealthy portion brown rice hey! At least better steamed, white rice strange, wormlike noodles I cant recall ever seeing Chinese cooking. Flat noodles Ive seen; especially I cook Vietnamese. But long round Nope; thats new me.. For less 10, combo plate worth money, even apex Chinese food good luck finding apex anywhere West Valley!. Were I big fan Chinese cooking like I used younger days, I never knew Thai; didnt touch Sushi; clue joys spending less basically stirfry Vietnamese Id probably come back here. That restaurant didnt wow lot personal tastes place. Frankly, Id surprised Wok Wei didnt last awhile already seems outsurvived predecessors. So, youre Goodyear want decent Chinese clean environment, friendly staff reasonable prices, dont Wok Wei place; get car go now, curse location somehow still kept bay."
37,EAs61Wm1O6tLjCs8t2eP-Q,"The food awesome, service quick, place hidden gem. I jalapeño chicken really spicy good spice. I cant wait get back try something else."
38,l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"We go original location 15414 N.19th Ave, lot. I thought would give new location 1825 W. Chandler Blvd, try part food good. Service hand lacking. Nothing like original location, 8 employees felt like none wanted take order helpanswer questions menu. One employees interested cookie eating bagging others customers waiting anyone. Another coming dining room eat still wearing gloves used serve food kitchen back kitchen without changing gloves. General cleanliness also lacking, dirty vents pipes head, leaking air vent soda area. In future going back original location."
39,l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"I pretty interested I went coworkers. The concept definitely cool food looked good pictures. I ordered Hengrenade Chicken w rice got drink. When I went get fountain drink, I pushed ice dispenser dead cockroach fell cup. I dumped cup made sure roach pretty big. I told lady front happened cockroach still there. She like Oh sorry, sprayed. Great, spray RAID ice something My wife chef Im pretty sure someone reports violation youre supposed something it, least empty god damn ice dispenser. I wasnt really quiet either, customers heard say came asked it. She gave new cup I got ice dispenser. A minutes later, I saw cook come use napkin remove dead roach fountain drink tray put garbage. I got food ok. The lady brought us food lady I reported problem super nice funny. I think roach thing ruined though. The food wasnt anywhere close perfect, wasnt bad either. The cookie REALLY good though"
40,l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"This place one favorites! I would call cheap MexicanAsian fusion food. Portions huge. As give enough food, also include cookie along meal. After finishing, I usually left overs meal two. To date, I yet try anything I havent liked here. The biggest downside wait. Come actually hungry always takes food come out."
41,EAs61Wm1O6tLjCs8t2eP-Q,"Food delicious! By far probably favorite asian cuisine spot AZ. We moved LA million great options, safe say say gave fix. Portion size amazing. The orange chicken probably one best Ive ever tried! Must must MUST try! You disappointed;"

43,l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"I regular customer Phoenix location many years. My mom introduced family restaurant 10 years ago I personally always loved food always thought best combination two favorite foods. Let start saying place hard find! I went evening located business park one sign front restaurant well lit forget patio dining. With said I tried location since I recently moved east valley. I ordered usual carnitas quesadilla, jade red chicken, chicken fried rice refried beans. Let start say beans canned none food hot maybe little warm. I impressed jade red chicken didnt taste like I remember wasnt even red, like sad version pandas orange chicken. The quesadilla little cheese carnitas tasted good dry lack cheese. Overall whole meal disappointment mostly Im use Phoenix location quality food all! I continue go Phoenix location never go back one."
44,l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"Being newbie Chino Bandido, I got take advantage free samples lesson order. I thought everything individually delicious, everything together plate, I wasnt sure mix flavors. I ordered carne asada burrito, teriyaki chicken, fried rice refried beans. I ultimately ate burrito beans together ate rice teriyaki together; otherwise, opposing flavors overload. I definitely return I find neighborhood, I may stick rice bowl combination doesnt mix many different flavors."

My last three experiences Chandler location past 4 months gotten progressively worse time. The recent past Sunday evening around 630 carry order. The person handled order nice. No issue here. Although concern arose mentioned current kitchen staff making Egg Foo Yung ordered first time. The Egg Foo Yung ended best part meal, well complimentary Snicker Doodle cookie. The Hengrenade Chicken dry leathery little flavor left it. The Diablo chicken also best effort, overcooked dry well. The fried rice tasted though steam pan hours...crunchy, dry flavorless. The kind thing I might expect end night lesser establishment. Im going dwell this, unless things change Chandler location, I really motivated return point. If Im North, Ill try 19th Ave location hopes issues occurring there. Frank Eve owners wonderful people, I hopeful take action get Chandler back really good Chinese Mexican fusion restaurant were."

The cilantro may taken bitter flavor cooked long...whatever case ...the flavor odd horrible taste hours. The staff nice accomadating. dont think venture again...ever."

72,dnB7SD38_lwiC9E-BJxq-Q,"Very cute place ! I chocolate croissant, yum!!! Cant wait go back try delicious menu items!"
73,l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"I would given place one star, free cookie deserved extra star. The snickerdoodles chewy delicious. As rest food, worth money calories. We saw place old episode DDD decided time try it. They make look A LOT better tv real life. Two couples walked us received food ten minutes received ours. I guess quesadilla takes ten minutes cook Try DDD places, NOT one."
74,EAs61Wm1O6tLjCs8t2eP-Q,"This place actually good! Ive twice, times I got walnut shrimp chef specials. It taste amazing. The complaint husband I rice American rice. Were asian thought, earth chinese restaurant American rice! And egg roll salty. But everything else great including customer service cleanliness!"
75,l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"I going original location Phoenix past 7 years I excited opened location Chandler. I cant believe yelpers commented decor. This isnt, never been, place going bring date order bottle wine table. It also isnt place going ask low fat, low calorie dish. Chinos fast food place folding tables, servers, meal comes tin throwaway plate, plastic silverware, plastic cups. You go food, combines Mexican Chinese flavors incredible taste! It may sound like would good, worth checking out. Good points The combination Mexican Chinese dishes incredible say least! If first time Chinos, ask sample dishes free. I highly recommend wont surprised order. You always receive free Snicker doodle always freshly baked day cookie Volcano chocolate fudge cookie weekends. You create meal lot different dishes rather ordering one dish. Bad points Only few; Chandler location somewhat hard find never there. Its tucked back behind Walgreens. Not big deal long know going. It bit confusing ordering fill small form ask help get there. The dish I always order following Hengrenade Chicken go Pollo Diablo looking kick homemade quesadilla, side Jade Red Chicken favorite popular, side black beans blend beans flavors soupy consistency, dont expect anything different, VERY good. Jerk Fried Rice. This around 10 drink fill up, especially free cookie. This one favorite places eat good, gut busting meal. Give stone Mexican panda restaurant little touch good luck."
76,EAs61Wm1O6tLjCs8t2eP-Q,"This go place Chinese food. We absolutely love it! The dinner combos lot food money. I havent tried anything I like. My family loves orange chicken sesame chicken. I like chicken mushrooms, moo goo gai pan, chicken broccoli fresh veggies put like zucchini carrots. This kind Chinese food eat, feel good eating it. Not like places greasiness. The staff nice too."
77,dnB7SD38_lwiC9E-BJxq-Q,"So big question Squarz live 5 star hype fellow yelpers!! Unfortunately I believe ... Thus far I would rate cute spot 3.5 average, amazing means. I believe reviews hyped up, ultimately I bit disappointed... On first visit I ordered 1 prosciutto, mozzarella, fig sandwich good, great surely fell short excellent. Maybe slip whoever sliced prosciutto sliced thick ... The best way serve prosciutto sandwich layered paper thin, melts mouth bite essentially falls apart easily chewed. It sliced way thick me, gave sandwich chewyrubbery like texture ... It could great suggestion applied maybe portion size increased bit. The side orange kind odd, better nothing I suppose. I would preferred small salad maybe sort soupsandwich combo. 2 tomato soup good, nice sized portion, fairly priced, lets face ... It tomato soup good, Ive better 3 I purchased frozen bag chicken mushroom pot pies warmed 3 dinner hit spot. They quite tasty probably best thing I tried today ... I would rate nearly 4... Once though, good, good I would rave friends family members. But, pretty cool able buy frozen bring home warm snack them. I would consider snack actual meal. The atmosphereambiance ehhhh I would say less desirable ... It little seating tight I dont think I would ever want eat in. It doesnt really resemble bakery cafe opinion ... In reality pastry fast food type establishment. But nothing wrong going .... Would I visit Yes, indeed less 2 miles house, I back pure convenience... Not necessarily food truly amazing. But, definitely better option local eateries. Plus, great customer service, food promptly ready I arrived, gentleman front counter pleasant kind. I found rather odd closed Saturdays Sundays though ... I would think place would get business weekends... But hey I know ;"

It worth walking How Order demo website know do. The staff extremely helpful I approached counter volunteered I ChinoBandido virgin. They even provided tasting samples suggestions helped understand different flavor profiles were. I settled combo 2 meat entrees, choice beans, choice rice chose Pollo Diablo meat alone, Jen Red Pork quesadilla, jerk fried rice black beans. All delicious servings generous. I dared finish quesadilla fear Oompah Loompahs would roll fat ass door afterward. I think theres bit learning curve eating here, I enjoyed unique dining experience. One staff even spotted Chico State shirt instantly started chatting, since also neck woods northern northern California, I like call it. I learned next time Im going meat entrees meat alone opposed burrito quesadilla, since enough sides fill extra packaging serves mask unique flavors savory meat choices. Ill make trip back, Im gonna save room first. The last meal resulted serious midafternoon lunch coma nap."

It flaky, tasty, fresh oven I could see I sat. It isnt big place tables. Nevertheless, still enjoy spending time corner hour. The owner super nice, sweet friendly towards us.

What u ask Ill definitely come back again."
86,EAs61Wm1O6tLjCs8t2eP-Q,"I really looking forward trying place, disappointment. We ordered Mongolian Beef Sesame Chicken combos go neither good. The Mongolian Beef worst Ive ever tasted, Sesame Chicken eh so. There good portion each, although I looking forward trying lo mein fried rice included combos. Not impressed all. The cheese puffs also included good, tasted like mini crab Rangoons without crab, egg rolls disgusting. Kind sad decent Chinese food places West Valley I craving awhile."
87,dnB7SD38_lwiC9E-BJxq-Q,"YUMMY!!! Discovered Squarz local farmers market return find perfection. Their assorted tasty pastries family favorite. We LOVE BBQ, Shepherds pie apple pastries. Support mom pop business shop local..."

I havent eaten good Chinese food since I moved Arizona 9 years ago. I definitely come back recommend restaurant."
89,l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"Heres story, Chinese chicken... served different styles rice... different sauces, lightest one Spicy. Heres story, beans burritos... black beans, others refried. Both tasty, also guaranteed keep pot night. So, one day chicken met beans burritos... knew much hunch... group somehow join together, thats way became greasy lunch. While I developing article I tried categorize Chino Bandido. I went back forth Mexican Chinese ten times I put categories. However, Chino really isnt Chinese, Mexican, ChineseMexican Fusion; really type food. Speaking Fusion, hell The Fusion comes Chino Bandido mix ethnic food stomach prohibit sort activity digesting. Anyway, lets get it. Chino nothing fancy. Its discreetly hidden behind Walgreens main road. When walk notice furnished Costco folding tables chairs, exposed duct work, concrete floor, little decoration walls except autographed Guy Fieri poster back. Its pretty simple. Gentleman, word wise dont expect get laid bring lady first date. As usual, I checked Chinos menu website I left house. Im rocket scientist, need quantum physics degree figure ordering system. However, Chino attempted make ordering bit easier implementing ordering instructions simulator website. The staff Chinos awesome guide ordering process let sample everything menu first anyway. If read previous post Costco samples, know Chino giving samples wins hearts minds book. My first time Chino I tried Jade Red Chicken, BBQ pork burrito, refried beans, Jerk Fried Rice. The Jade red chicken decent. It like General Tsos Chicken steroids. A fried texture; super spicy super sweet. The BBQ pork alright little bland. While reading Yelp I remember running across someones Yelp review stated loved Jade Red Chicken much pissed BBQ pork share plate it. Uh yeah, didnt bother much. The Jerk fried rice pretty good well... included jerk chicken green onions. Chinos gets props originality, giving lot food, making easy take home leftovers. Once slap cardboard lid set take home breakfast next day. The best part Chino Bandido best value bonus give you; Snickerdoodle Chocolate Volcano cookie baked weekends. I opted Chocolate Volcano cookie let say thing damn good. I admit food probably enough bring back Chino Bandido often, cookie might make happen. And fusion, maybe next week I try KoreanEthiopianChilean mix. You never know."
90,dnB7SD38_lwiC9E-BJxq-Q,Wow! My daughter I got back lunch. 13 layers pastry pot pie AND creme brule dessert. Really. You must go try them! Inexpensive deliver! And SUPER nice people. This individual businesses look like.

98,l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"I remember eating Chino Bandido ever since I kid. I always went original location west side Greenway. My favorite always Jade Red Chicken, Egg Foo Young, Chile Relleno. The black beans also beans choice. If manage restaurant theyre serving volcano cookies, consider lucky. Ive always hoped Id serve I always end snickerdoodles. Which good well, volcano cookies wayyy better."
99,l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"So freaked right now. We asked lime corona working register, grabbed limes dirty fingers. After chef heard put happy hour order in, screamed happy hour started banging things around. Then order came refried beans instead black beans. Flys buzzing around food. I freaked eat spent 17.46. Should I risk it, try food"
100,EAs61Wm1O6tLjCs8t2eP-Q,Went lunch special General Tsos chicken....I dont know whats changed tastes like shit! The dish supposed chicken..its nothing bit balls flour tossed sauce. The rice supposed fried rice....its white rice colored brown knows what. Im disappointed returning ever place. AJK way better this.
101,l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,We divided family one. Husband likes it. Wifenot much. Wife writing review. Our favorite egg foo young Snickerdoodle cookies. Sometimes good; sometimes suckscookies included. Check takeout orders carefully. Not always correct. I usually recommend eating Im hungry.
102,l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"Interesting asianmexican fusion theme taste ok. Great place go want fill stomach cheap price. Best part snicker doodle give meal. Ordering kind odd nice make anything burrito, quesadilla eat alone price. Place bare bones, cafeteria type tablesbenches."
103,l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"Miss place. Used work computer repair store next Walgreens amazing place lunch. Disappointed, I make haul PHX Chino."
104,l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"Okaaay, fiance really wanted go dinner last night, I weary, sounded really greasy. So I talked something else, today, pleeeease, Chino Tori Fine, I gave in. Ill give Chino, original idea. Mexican, Jamaican Chinese fusion, executed well all. Like someone said before, whole ordering process, especially first timers needs somehow streamlined, ridiculous, like need help desk something. But part initiation get taste test ordering, I guess good. The location waaaay back weird building, weird weird, weird good. There also way much space inside, gives cafeteria feel. Now food...the jerk chicken Chris ordered pretty good, sweet n sour chicken rice. My lunch hand disaster, I ate half his. I ordered emerald chicken, I get choice served rice quesidilla, I chose dilla. Well, wrong choice. See pic I posted, quesidilla glistening!! We could eat it. It pool grease. Gross. So Chino, I ideas ya. Get together, cool concept, learn make food consistently good, maybe toasting quesidillas instead frying Hire professional look menu give suggestions prep. Second, ordering system needs attention, confusing. Thirdly, space weird desolate, interior changes would good thing."
105,l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"The food tasted great I loved decor. They 12,000 lb black granite panda wearing sombrero. That cool. The food great expensive, menu disaster study write proper codes could order. This really wasnt needed people line. Also I got sick eating junk, last 4hours still sucked."
106,l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"There 2 loves life Chinese food Mexican food. To think fused one delicious delight makes believe built place honor me. Its great little fast food place pretty good portions. The menu little confusing. There many acronyms much writing involved. I wanna eat! Their signature dish jade chicken kinda like Mexican style orange chicken. Pretty good would say. The Jerk Chicken packs punch kick spiciness. The rice served little dry bueno eat dry food spicy food together, still delicious overall. If one LA would go time. Great food, great prices, great portions. Fast food best."
107,l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"Lets admit place neither Chinese Mexican. Not I problem that. I see another Panda Express Baja Fresh good ole American fast food. I twice food good times. I tried jade red chicken, emerald chicken, machaca, carnitas, cuban black beans, refried beans, pork fried rice. My favorites jade red chicken pork fried rice. On second visit, food little salty, again, American fast food. The snickerdoodle cookie also nice touch. I need sure make one day volcano cookie. Portions big enough leftovers another meal. This granted I always pick quesadilla one combo choices. Service good visits even though workers seem little young. They friendly, helped menu, gave samples first timers. I admit, 10 combo drink high fast food joint, somehow, I know I going back. Oh yeah, 10, better plastic lawn chairs tables."
108,l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"So bf I went new location Chandler. It set back road slightly hidden, bit hard find. The inside huge. Like warehouse. The walls lined plastic outdoor tables chairs. Kind weird whatever. The food INTERESTING. Some things I tried good good. I Red Chicken, Diablo quesadilla Jerk Fried Rice. The Diablo chicken incredibly salty greasy. I would order again. The Red Chicken bomb! And Jerk Chicken alone amazing. I also tasted Emerald Chicken good, weird. My bf loved Jerk Chicken Red Chicken. I would definitely go back try things. I love variety. And price really great deal. You get lot food drink 10! If looking something cheap lots options I would recommend it! If mom town visiting, take somewhere bit nicer."
109,dnB7SD38_lwiC9E-BJxq-Q,"Love supporting small businesses Im glad I found little place so! Food delicious, I tried little.of everything pastries point. I enjoyed all, even mac cheese! The owner sweetheart well working alone Friday night! Thats great commitment I back sure!"
110,l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"Been numerous times, usually Id rate 4 5. Lately, however, appears management never duty. They slow inattentive. I called ahead large party around 20 people nearly week advance, hours alotted time. Upon arrival, tables neatly set aside marked reserved. However, cooks didnt show work, management didnt see point two Saturday night. It took hour us get food. AN HOUR! The place slammed, good them, watched customers ended leaving instead staying waiting hour food. The wait ridiculous, especially since arrived scheduled time number people said would have. Ive never original Chino Bandido, apparently one isnt able accomodate groups size reasonable time period. This second time brought group Chino, I guarantee last."
111,l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"So Ive going Chino Bandido place number years. Great concept ChineseMexican Confusion without pretense. At original location horsey races give Chino Bandido virgins whole flavor sample deal almost get full meal trying different possible fillings. So Chandler location I didnt notice whole ritual. It figure want fill order sheet. The order sheet seems trip lot folks. It aint rocket science quantum finance, folks. Dont even look sheet. Figure want eat first look sheet see photo figure express that. Its easy. You get 14 items choose Carnitas, Chile Relleno, Chinese BBQ Pork, Egg Foo Yung, Gringo Chicken, Hengrenade Chicken, Jade Red Chicken, Jen Red Pork, Jerk Chicken, Emerald Chicken, Teriyaki Chicken, Veggie Salad, Pollo Diablo, Machaca. Got Now choose get rice bowl, combination, Quesadilla, Burrito. For rice bowl, choose one item steamed rice optional beans well. You also add fried rice 75 cents. For combo, choose two different items says 120 I think meant 14 circle either BLK Black REF refried beans. Then also choose type fried rice want. JFR Jerk Fried Rice, CFR Chicken Fried Rice, PKFR pork fried rice, PLFR plain fried rice. This pretty much fullon big plate. You also get items either burrito quesadilla specifying Q B. This way get burrito quesadilla addition fried rice beans. You also get items Quesadillas. You mix one item together youre daring. Same burritos. You also order rice beans separate side didnt get rice bowl combo wanted anyway. You get pint quart well want take home. Finally, cookies. You get free cookie anyway one aint enough space order half dozen dozen. Drinks pretty much self explanatory. I like place. I dont need endorsement Guy Fieri justify liking place. This occasional lunch outing coworkers mood strikes. Lately Ive getting Quesadillas Burritos skipping whole rice beans thing. I dont need fall asleep meetings thank you. One thing location even though dont need higher education fill order form might still need sextant, compass, telescope, charts find place. The Google map makes look like right Chandler deep southeast mall. Lots parking necessarily right next place lunch rush."
112,dnB7SD38_lwiC9E-BJxq-Q,"Everything made squares. The croissant buttery tasty. I also tried one spinach pies, flavorful, still good! Staff helpful friendly"
113,EAs61Wm1O6tLjCs8t2eP-Q,"Great location Goodyear. Restaurant clean indoors outdoors. We seated right away young waitress quick, kind zero mistake. My girl ordered veggie fried rice veggie lo mein.

There isnt anything like anywhere else Phoenix. While describe fusion three types food, honestly that. Just throw bowl, doesnt make fusion. Chino Bandido fulfills cravings, them, once. Want chinese mexican little jamaican Right Okay! Go here. Although better actual restaurants, Chino Bandido definitely better fast lunch spots. I could seriously eat everyday months dish. As far uniquely Phoenix experience, that, must. When start actually create items mashing things together... itll Phoenix Must. Until then, one best quick lunches get."
