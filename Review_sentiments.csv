EAs61Wm1O6tLjCs8t2eP-Q,Worst service they never check up on you if you need more drink and food was alright. Only saw our waitress once when she brought us our food and after two pick up her check.,negative
EAs61Wm1O6tLjCs8t2eP-Q,I recommend there orange chicken and Mongolian beef probably one of my top 5 Asian restaurants,negative
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"Large area. Didnt get the menu, bare with me i was a first time customer who was in a lunch break. Finally figured it out after 5 minutes, tried the jade chicken it was meh not special. Quesadillas are a bit hard. Nope not coming back.",negative
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"Chini bandido.....good food in a hidden place in one of the strip malls
...jade chicken was good and the bkack beans were very good...almost cuban style. The carnitas burrito....well it is sorry behind excuse for a burrito and it wasn't that good. Comes in aluminum bowl and plastic utensils.....i guess to save on washing dishes. The place has sort of escuela cafeteria experience to it. However, the staff is friendly and they even give you samples.  I expect more out of this place....they should do dim sum Mexican or something...now that would be interesting.",positive
EAs61Wm1O6tLjCs8t2eP-Q,"Nice little place with good portions. Usually go for lunch and the portions definately fill you up. Meal comes with rice, spring roll, soup, cream puff and whatever you order. Lunch runs about $5-8/person. Good customer service.",positive

dnB7SD38_lwiC9E-BJxq-Q,"Squarz is a hidden gem. The owner/baker is so friendly and takes the time to describe the menu. I've had the chocolate croissant, Kouign Amann, and mac & cheese. Everything I've had here has been top knotch. The Kouign Amann is a stand out (buttery, flaky, and not overwhelming sweet).

I can't wait to come back to try the entire menu. Also, if you buy 5 pastries, you get the 6th for free. More incentive to be a glutton!",positive
EAs61Wm1O6tLjCs8t2eP-Q,"We ate here last Wednesday for the first time. Finding myself on my own tonight, I decided to go for takeout. I ordered the broccoli beef and it was DELICIOUS!! Lots of beef and broccoli in a yummy sauce.  Plus the serving size was enough for dinner and lunch tomorrow. This will definitely be our go to Asian place! I definitely recommend it.",positive
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"OMG this place is soooo amazing!  I never thought a Chinese-Mexican fusion place would be so good.  I came here while out in Phoenix for Spring Training.  It was suggested by some friends that had come earlier in the month.  I love trying new places but was scared because I had my entire family with me.  Every single person just loved their food.  

I had a combo plate with Jerk chicken, Jade chicken and Jerk fried rice.  It came with choice of beans and I suggest you get the black beans!  Delicious!!!  And a added bonus a yummy cookie.  How much better can this meal get?

Just a little warning, if you don't like spicy food pass on the jerk style.  

This was our cheapest and best meal of the entire trip!  If we would have come here first we may have eaten here everyday!!!!",positive
dnB7SD38_lwiC9E-BJxq-Q,"Met the owner/baker today when I went in to grab lunch for the first time; and even though he was clearly having a rough day, he was super nice and polite.

Got the chicken pot pie and the chicken and mushroom.  Both AMAZING.  I have to say I really appreciate the way they loosely wrap them in aluminum foil and then put them in a paper pocket.  I was a little worried that by the time I got back to my office they would only be lukewarm, but they were still piping hot, and since they weren't sealed in tightly, they weren't soggy at all.  

These flaky, delicious pastries were probably some of the best savory puff pastry I've ever had.",positive
EAs61Wm1O6tLjCs8t2eP-Q,"Love this place the house noodle soup, egg drop and sizzle fried rice are all amazing. All combos are very feeling.

l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"see this picture posted by another yelper: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA?select=nEEtzmZrXXFr-egtbVSF6A
That's the size portion I'm used to from Chino Bandido.  What we got last week was about 3/4 of that.  


My husband and I have been ordering the combo of jerk chicken, jade red chicken, chicken fried rice and black beans ever since this location opened in Chandler. And have always been satisfied.   

I was so shocked at the portion that I asked the employees what happened.  Their explanation is that they ""have not downsized the portions, because the portions were being over-sized incorrectly before.   So, now the portions are the right size.""  And looking through the other yelper photos, i see one from '08 that looks similar to (but still more than) the portions size we got last weekend.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA?select=kGQgU8IelC8DABJQSdIYoQ  So, oK, well, I can understand what the employee was talking about, but, it still is rather disappointing.   Considering that we've ordered the combo more times than I can count, and have never had the ""mini/correct"" portion-size ever before until last weekend. 

They also used to give my daughter a small cup of rice with a little bit of plain chicken.  this time, when I asked for a little kiddie cup, they gave me the same size cup, but it was empty...

The one thing they give generously still are those big huge sugar cookies.  Unfortunately, we can only ever finish half of those.  I'd rather get a free cup of rice for my daughter, than three big sugar cookies.  If ever we go back, i'll ask if they'll do that for me.  But, we're not likely to come back again even though we like the food, it's just not affordable for our family anymore.  One combo wouldn't even satisfy me as it is now.  For my husband and I, I'd say if we ordered three combo meals, that would be filling.",negative

dnB7SD38_lwiC9E-BJxq-Q,"I went about two months back and never had written a review, until I saw Ian's review down below and felt I should leave something.

I also got the chicken pot pie, mac n cheese, and a lemonade, all of which I found to be amazing.  My brother had the mac n cheese himself, and we agreed it was probably top 10 (non fine dining) mac n cheeses we could remember.  

The pot pie was fresh and tasted home made, but don't go there thinking you're going to receive a traditional pot pie (think more of a casserole filling inside a flaky crust).  

After our meal, we were brought out two free caramelized dessert croissants that were just fantastic, and I will gladly pay next time.

Their food stands on its own merits, but the customer service is just unbeatable compared to any other small business eatery that I have frequented in the past few years.",positive
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"I love Chino's for the laid back good fast food it is. It isn't a place you go for impressions but to get good food, lots of it at a decent price. The food has always been good when I have been there and on Sat and Sun you get a free cookie with your meal, nice yummy fresh baked cookies!

I generally go for the Jade Red Chicken, Jerk Chicken and double Jerk Fried rice, a nice spicy meal for sure! 

They offer free tastes of their more popular items so you can make a good decision before ordering. 

Ordering is super easy, grab a paper and a pen and just fill in the blanks, and heck if you screw it up, no worries they always make sure you get the right stuff.",positive
EAs61Wm1O6tLjCs8t2eP-Q,By far the best Chinese I've had in Arizona. Really clean place with friendly counter girls. I recommend this place to all my friends and family. Dinner combos are a great deal and you get a TON of food.,positive
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"Love this place!  

I have been away from the Valley for a decade. Chino's in North Phoenix was a favorite lunch destination. This location is hard to find but so much cleaner. 

Great food. Jerk chicken burrito and chile relent quesadilla. Yum. A complimentary snicker doodle to go...too. I dream about the refried black beans.",positive
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"Rice is rock hard.   Jaded chicken taste like its been sitting there for days.  Brought it to the young girls attention and they had to say was oh.  Plenty of people eating here but maybe they didn't get the rice?
I think I may have just come to
Late and there menu is to big for them to make it fresh when they order it.   Oh well. Plus they give you free chips and salsa for a good review on this.  Reason for all the stars on here? You decided but don't say I didn't warn you.    Maybe there chips are good and worth the stars.  Guess I'll never know",positive
EAs61Wm1O6tLjCs8t2eP-Q,Horrible service! They didn't even come and check up on me and my guest! I had to ask my friend for some of their drink because i didn't have anymore! It was all about the money their! Smh ! They need to be closed down!,negative
EAs61Wm1O6tLjCs8t2eP-Q,"We have been here several times..ok, maybe at least three times a month for several months. 

It is so good. Finally some great Chinese food in the West Valley! 

One of my favorites is the Moo Shu Chicken. I get it every time.  My hubby usually gets the Kung Pao Chicken or Mongolian Beef. We always get Orange Chicken for the kiddos. I LOVE that they always use white meat chicken- and the Orange Chicken isn't fried but cooked in the wok.  

The servings are huge. The Hot and Sour Soup is great and the Chicken Egg Drop soup is heaven when you have a cold and need some comfort. 
I would highly recommend you try Wok Wei!",negative
dnB7SD38_lwiC9E-BJxq-Q,"I became intimately acquainted.... no, I should say obsessed... with the caramelized croissants at the Farmer's Market at Roadrunner Park... thank you for being there!  It gives me a reason to get my butt out of bed EARLY on a Saturday morning and walk the mile to the market because I know you'll be there!!!  These things are so messy, flakey, sticky & sweet that I just cannot imagine a week going by without having one!!!!  Someday I'll drive to Tempe to see the store, but for now... it's my weekly indulgence!!  How did it start?  Just a simple sample.  truly love at first bite!!",positive
dnB7SD38_lwiC9E-BJxq-Q,"OMG is the sum of the review. I saw Squarz at a farmers market for the first time this year. I didn't get to try their food but it looked amazing. Then I just forgot to go even though they're down the street from me. I went to another farmers market and who did I see again, Squarz. This time I tried a pie. I absolutely love puff pastry and they had so many too choose from. A couple weeks later I was reminded by my friend who went with me to the market, to go to squarz. I wish i would have walked out with more. So good. Amazing and super friendly staff. Will definitely be back.",positive

Chino, I LOVED you! How could you do this to me?!",positive
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"I don't think there is anything worse about this place than it's location. When a bigger landmark is a sign next door that says ""Wide Shoes"" you are in geographical hell. This place is rarely busy but has tons of space and lots of potential. I have eaten there a bunch and love it. The jerk rice is killer. (someone here totally dissed it saying the only spice in it was pepper...umm...no) You really should try it and you will see. The combinations I have found to be my favorite are jade red chicken or sweet roasted pork in a quesadilla. Those are combinations of flavors that you would never expect to be that good. 

In my opinion they could make some changes and be making 10 times the money. 
#1. Get a normal freakin menu. You can't go this place and say I will have a number six with a large soft drink. None of us want to work or do much thinking to order our food. They want to do their sample demonstrations and they usually have time since NOBODY GOES THERE. I wish they would even have the guts to pilot a simplified menu--I think they would be shocked at how much more business they would get. 
#2 Get a few conventional items on the menu i.e. Nachos or chips and salsa or something that is a good snacky kind of food. 
#3 Come up with a signature item or two and give them original names rather than all of the all-menu-items-are-equal approach. 

It is worth checking out if you have not been there and I enjoy eating there still. It's a bit cafeteria/industrial warehouseish with not much to check out other than the statue of the panda in a sombrero.",positive
dnB7SD38_lwiC9E-BJxq-Q,"I am pretty much obsessed with pot pie, so I was excited to find this place. The food was great. The chicken pot pie was better than I hoped for! Reasonably priced, a little small (only because it was so good, I wanted like 10 more ), but big on flavor. I was worried it would be dry, but there was a perfect proportion of pastry to meat to veggies to gravy. My kids had chicken pot pies, mac & cheese, fruit and lemonade, and they happily devoured it all.

The man taking our order (assuming he is an owner) asked my daughter about herself and she was excited to tell him it was her birthday. When the food was ready, he surprised us with a birthday dessert for her. He seriously has no idea how much I appreciated that - it made my daughter feel SO special! She is such a sweet girl and it made her day to have a stranger do something thoughtful for her. He was also asking me how he could make the store more kid friendly, and seemed to genuinely care about the overall enjoyment of his customers. We couldn't be happier to find delicious, reasonably-priced, homemade food, along with wonderful customer service. We will definitely be back!",positive
EAs61Wm1O6tLjCs8t2eP-Q,"The best Chinese food I've tried in so long! I always get the combo, which brings a side of rice, chow-mien, your choice of entree, an egg roll and a cream cheese puff and even your choice of soup! BIG servings too! Good food :)",positive
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"I really wanted to like this place.  The lady that gave me the samples were super nice, the food tasted pretty good as the samples.  The whole idea is very interesting.  I truly wanted to like this place.

I ordered the diablo chicken in a cheese quesadilla and the red jade chicken in a burrito.  I chose to go with the jerk fried rice and refried beans.  

So, the food came and looked pretty good, and a lot for the price.  But it just didnt taste all that great.  The red jade chicken was just the meat wrapped in a tortilla.  Nothing else in the ""burrito"".  The meat was all questionable... when I order chicken I like to see whole pieces of white meat, not grey/clear meat covered in batter.  The diablo chicken was kind of odd with the cheese.  The only thing that tasted fantastic was the snickerdoodle that came with the meal.

So the meal was just so-so... then I got back to the office... bad times ahead followed by another bad time at home.  Something just didn't sit right.  I can't recommend this place to anyone unless you enjoy an personal opera show in the bathroom.",positive
dnB7SD38_lwiC9E-BJxq-Q,"I saw this place a few days ago as I was looking for a good place to celebrate PI day, but time got away and I wasn't able to make it.  This morning on my drive in to work their name came up on the radio and I knew that it was destiny that I eat here.

I came with a group of 8 people thinking we could sit and enjoy a nice lunch together.  As we walked up we notice how small the building was and our plans quickly changed.  

Walking in we could immediately smell the delicious food being cooked in the back.  We placed our orders and the man was nice enough he seemed overwhelmed and frazzled at how many people had stopped by this afternoon.  He did advise that it would take a while for the food as they weren't prepared.  We enjoyed the weather and he offered lemonade while we waited. 

I ordered the turkey and Swiss and was very happy with my selection, because it was amazing.  It was not your typical sandwich the bread made it. The mac and cheese was good but not fantastic. I was very disappointed with the lack of flavor.  I also ordered an apple pie which was good but so small and not nearly enough.  The chocolate croissant was good but again not fantastic.  I had a bite of someone's Shepards pie and it was underwhelming as well.  Someone in our party ordered a feta and spinach pie but got chicken and mushrooms.  

I think it was a good place but not worth all the hype.  I will be back for another sandwich but I definitely will order ahead and save my money and not order anything extra",positive
EAs61Wm1O6tLjCs8t2eP-Q,"The Husband and I went here for a quick dinner on a Wednesday night around 8pm.  We were seated right away, it wasn't crowded.  Service was extremely fast, yet everything tasted fresh.  I ordered the Sesame chicken and white rice.  My Hubby got the same, but the full meal, which came with egg rolls, soup and also noodles of some sort. He usually cleans his plate and eats whatever is left on mine, but even he couldn't finish his plate.  It was SOOO much food!  My chicken alone fed both of us the next day and we even had enough for my grandma to make a small plate.  I loved the flavors and loved the fact that pretty much every dish is made with white meat chicken....No mystery meat here!  I also ordered a To-Go order of combination fried rice with shrimp, pork and chicken to have for lunch the next day.  It was excellent.  We'll definitely go back!  Can't beat speedy service and good food!",positive
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"Chino Bandito is by far one of my favorite places to eat. I seriously go out of my way to make a stop there. I have been eating at Chino's for 9 years and I doubt I will ever stop going! They have two locations in the valley and I have been to both more times than I can recall. Both are excellent options for your first visit to Chinos. If you want to get lunch I would recommend that you get there early because this place gets crowded during lunch. Chino's has some very loyal fans and a somewhat complicated system for ordering. The best part is that the staff is always so helpful and attentive. They will walk you through the ordering process as many times as you desire. 

The portions are huge and the cost isn't bad either. Plan to spend about 8 or 10 bucks per person and you will probably have leftovers. The staff is exceptionally helpful, and will take the time to give you a sample of every single item on the menu before you ever spend a dime! I don't know of any other restaurant in the world that gives out this much free food (samples). I personally recommend the black beans with the pork-fried rice paired with a jade red chicken quesadilla and a jen red pork burrito. This is my usual at Chinos although I have tried nearly every side and entre on the menu.",positive

l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"i've only been here once based on numerous positive reviews on multiple sites.  i thought the service was awesome, they gave many samples as it was our first time there.  the decor is very plain, but i guess it would be nice for a quick bite or take out.
 
i had the jerk chicken, my gf had the quesadilla with pork... of course i liked hers better.

my little boy loved it too, especially the beans.

the prices cant be beat for what you get and the great taste of the food.

i will definitely be going back to try more of their menu.",positive
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"I don't know why there aren't more Chinese-Mexican fusion places, maybe because the name conjures up some frightening images.  Vanquish those scary thoughts because this place is great!  My persona favorite is their Emerald Chicken Quesadilla.  And how can you go wrong when you get a snicker doodle cookies with your food?

Steer clear if you're looking for anything even slightly resembling ""authentic"" Chinese or Mexican, but if that's what you were expecting from a place called ""Chino Bandito"" with a Bandito Panda chowing down with a pair of chopsticks you shouldn't be allowed to choose where you eat anyway.",positive
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"Love this place, one of my husband and mine all time favorites. It's casual but really fun unique food that packs a great fusion flavor.  They allow newbies to try samples, so it would well for bringing people to try it. .. the combo deals are the way to go.",positive
EAs61Wm1O6tLjCs8t2eP-Q,"It was with sincere trepidation that I went to dinner at Wok Wei the other night.  It's not that I heard bad things about the place; not at all.  But I was afraid I might actually LIKE it ... and if you've lived here long enough, you know that the turnover of restaurants in this apparently cursed spot is quick and often.  The last restaurant here was a BBQ place and before I even had a chance to try it, off it went!  

As it turns out, the food was indeed worth the effort.  The place is incredibly clean and pleasing to the eye (though the low-hanging lamps over the booths do give a slight feeling of being interrogated).  Though the place is small, the 18 booths and tables don't give off a feeling of being crammed in.  The wait staff is friendly and helpful, though there are some communication problems due to some linguistic comprehension problems.

As you probably already know, most Chinese restaurants have combination plates, which can be a really good deal if you, and at least one other person, have the same tastes in food.  Thankfully, this restaurant has taken the concept further by offering combination plates on ALL their entrees  (so if your date stands you up on a Friday night or you're just too obnoxious to get a date in the first place, you don't have to break the bank ordering a la carte).

The egg rolls are quite good and large and not very greasy at all, which is sort of unusual for egg rolls.  The crab puffs are more like a-tiny-bit-of-Philadelphia-Cream-Cheese-between-large-fried-noodles, but still good. The hot 'n sour soup is good, but nothing like I've ever had before.

I ordered the Mongolian Beef, which, to me, was a bit too salty; however, I never use salt at home, so I'm pretty sensitive to it when it's used.  Probably, for the average American, it isn't really salty at all.  The combo plate comes with an (un)healthy portion of brown rice --- hey!  At least it's better than steamed, white rice --- and some strange, wormlike noodles I can't recall ever seeing in any Chinese cooking.  Flat noodles I've seen; especially as I cook Vietnamese.  But long and round?  Nope; that's new for me..

For less than $10, the combo plate is worth the money, even if it's not the apex of Chinese food (and good luck finding that apex anywhere out in the West Valley!).  

Were I a big fan of Chinese cooking like I used to be in my younger days, when I never knew Thai; didn't touch Sushi; and had no clue about the joys of spending less for basically the same stir-fry at Vietnamese --- I'd probably come back here.  That the restaurant didn't ""wow"" me has a lot more to do with my personal tastes than with this place.  Frankly, I'd be surprised if Wok Wei didn't last awhile (it already seems to have outsurvived its predecessors).

So, if you're in Goodyear and you want some decent Chinese in a very clean environment, with friendly staff and reasonable prices, don't ""Wok Wei"" from this place; get in your car and go now, while the curse of its location is somehow still kept at bay.",positive
EAs61Wm1O6tLjCs8t2eP-Q,"The food was awesome,  the service was quick, and this place is a hidden gem.  I had the jalapeño chicken it is really spicy but it's a good spice.  I can't wait to get back and try something else.",positive
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"We go to the original location 15414 N.19th Ave, a lot. I thought we would give the new location 1825 W. Chandler Blvd, a try for the most part the food was as good.

Service on the other hand was more then lacking. Nothing like the original location, 8 employees and felt like none wanted to take the order or help/answer questions about the menu.

One of the employees was more interested in the cookie she was eating while bagging the others for customers then waiting on anyone. Another coming out in to the dining room to eat and still wearing his gloves he used to serve food in the kitchen then back into the kitchen without changing the gloves.

General cleanliness also lacking, dirty vents and pipes over head, leaking air vent over soda area.

In the future we will be going back to the original location.",positive
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"I was pretty interested when I went here with my co-workers.  The concept was definitely cool and the food looked good in the pictures.  I ordered the Hengrenade Chicken w/ rice and got a drink.  

When I went to get the fountain drink, I pushed the ice dispenser in and a dead cockroach fell out into my cup.  I dumped the cup out and made sure it was a roach (and it was pretty big).  I told a lady at the front what happened and that the cockroach is still there.  She was like ""Oh sorry, they just sprayed"".  Great, so did they spray RAID on the ice or something?

My wife is a chef and I'm pretty sure when someone reports a violation you're supposed to do something about it, at least empty the god damn ice dispenser.  I wasn't really quiet about it either, other customers heard me say it and came up and asked me about it.  She gave me a new cup and I got ice from the other dispenser.  A few minutes later, I saw a cook come over and use a napkin to remove the dead roach from the fountain drink tray and put it into the garbage.

I got the food and it was ok.  The lady who brought us the food (not the lady I reported the problem too) was super nice and funny.  I think the roach thing ruined it for me though.  The food wasn't anywhere close to perfect, but it wasn't bad either.  The cookie was REALLY good though",positive
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"This place is one of our favorites!  I would call it cheap Mexican/Asian fusion food.  Portions are huge.  As if they do not give you enough food, they also include a cookie along with the meal.  After finishing, I usually have left overs for a meal or two.  To date, I have yet to try anything I haven't liked here.

l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"I have been a regular customer at the Phoenix location for many years. My mom introduced my family to this restaurant  over 10 years ago I personally have always loved the food and always thought it was the best combination of my two favorite foods.

Let me start off by saying this place is so hard to find! I went in the evening an it's located in a business park with only one sign and the front of the restaurant is not well lit so forget about patio dining.

With that being said I tried this location since I recently moved to the east valley. I ordered my usual carnitas quesadilla, jade red chicken, chicken fried rice and refried beans. Let just start off to say the beans were canned and none of the food was hot maybe a little warm. I was not impressed with the jade red chicken it didn't taste like what I remember it wasn't even red, it was more like a sad version of pandas orange chicken.  The quesadilla had very little cheese and some carnitas which tasted good but was dry from the lack of cheese. Overall the whole meal was a disappointment mostly because I'm so use to the Phoenix location and the quality of food is not the same at all! I will continue to go to the Phoenix location but will never go back the this one.",positive
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"Being a newbie to Chino Bandido, I got to take advantage of the free samples and lesson on how to order.  I thought everything individually was delicious, but once everything was together on my plate, I wasn't so sure of the mix of flavors.  I ordered a carne asada burrito, teriyaki chicken, fried rice and refried beans.  I ultimately ate the burrito and beans together and then ate the rice and teriyaki together; otherwise, it was opposing flavors overload.  I will definitely return again if I find myself in the neighborhood, but I may just stick with a rice bowl or a combination that doesn't mix so many different flavors.",positive

Also the Jade Red chicken was good. However we didn't care to much for the Jerk fried rice, beans and the Emerald chicken. Overall the food was ok and your food comes out fast.",negative
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"The food is an awesome fusion of Mexican and Chinese food. When you get a combo you get a lot of food, enough to share. Ordering can be a but confusing but they are always helpful and they leave you with a complimentary cookie that tastes homemade. I do think it is strange that there is never any music playing in their huge dining area.",positive
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"I love this place the only problem is that the last few times I have gone there the service was a little less than what I am used to.  The cook and the cashier were arguing over my order and I was hoping it wouldn't get taken out on my food!!!! 
I would definitely eat here again.  
Recommend the emerald chicken, black beans, chicken fried rice, and jerk chicken quesadilla",negative

dnB7SD38_lwiC9E-BJxq-Q,"I don't usually write 5* reviews from my bed while I'm still wiping croissant crumbs off my rack, after just one delivery ""visit"" but we live in strange times, and today was a stressful day. People decompress in different ways: mine was to check the Yelp! app to see if Squarz delivered, because I was dreaming about Joyce W's pictures from the other day. 

So, as I sit here watching the end of ""Titanic"" on Lifetime, still hating Rose because she literally let go of Jack right after saying ""I'll never let go,"" I decided to upload my pics and drop a quick review. Originally I ordered through Eat24, and the owner called to say they were out of cinnamon roll croissants; as he rattled off alternatives I remembered Joyce's picture of the creme brûlée croissant and chose that instead. I also ordered: spinach & feta, shepherds, and chicken pot pies, the prosciutto, mozzarella & fig sandwich, with fresh fruit, mac & cheese with bacon and creamy garlic mashed potato sides, and the creamy tomato soup. Annnd a kouign-amann and the aforementioned creme brûlée...Don't judge me, people, today sucked! 

Anyway, all of the above arrived quickly, and piping hot. The owner delivered it himself, and told Scott he threw in a ""couple (three!) of (chocolate) croissants because we were out of cinnamon."" Super nice and appreciated. Everything was delicious, I took a quick bite of the spinach and feta pie, then literally tore open the dessert container to taste the caramelized kouign-amman, Scott's mouth was agape at my ferocity, ha! It.is.perfection. So, naturally I had to try the creme brûlée before eating my dinner: the top layer shattered, the croissant was flaky, and the pastry cream between layers took it to another level of dessert Nirvana. I did eventually taste my sandwich, which was a savory-sweet balance I loved, the soup, and the sides. Each item was truly noteworthy, Scott enjoyed the savory pies and desserts. 

We are going back. I don't care if I have to live on the stairmaster, and drag my old butt to Pump more often, this is worth it. I'm already impressed with the customer service, and the food is phenomenal. You can taste the love in the products! 

Now excuse me while I go into a carb coma...",positive

EAs61Wm1O6tLjCs8t2eP-Q,"I really like the food here and the restaurant itself is very nice and extremely clean. Although I haven't eaten inside I've picked up two different combos. 

 I'm not a coniseur of Chinese food but I know enough to when something is good. The first time I had the kung pao chicken combo which comes with fried rice(which isn't your typical fried rice but still really good) chow mein, egg roll, two cream cheese puffs, + your choice of soup. I didn't have the soup because they will only give to you if you eat in. So I can't judge the soup. 
The second time I had the general tsos chicken. Same sides included. 
I enjoyed both combos but preferred the kung pao because of the spice and vegetables. 
My one and only complaint-The Price. $9.55 for each one of these combos. But the price is justified because you get a lot of food, a lot. It's enough for two women to share. I'm a man and can finish it, gorging of course. But I'd prefer not to. 
And that's my tip to the owners-you need to offer a little less food on the dinner combo for $2 less. I'm retisent to order the combos anymore because of the amount of food. I'm a fan of combos so I'm at a loss. Maybe the lunch special is less food because the combos are much cheaper for those lunch specials??? But I'm not in the area around lunch time so I can't order that lunch. 
Other than that you won't be sorry if you can eat a lot of food.",positive
dnB7SD38_lwiC9E-BJxq-Q,"Warm comfort food and warm comfortable service from probably the friendliest staff I've ever met (only the owner was in at the time and he was so kind to let his employee go early since it was a very slow evening). I had the chicken and mushroom pie.

Definitely recommend 100%.",positive

It was huge and full of shrimp, veggies and lots of wontons.  Overall a very good meal at a reasonable price. We will be back.",positive
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"First impression: Are we in a cafeteria?  There were lines of table and chairs that reminded me of elementary school.  My coworker told me to go up and try the samples for new comers.  The girl behind the counter was very nice and offered me a large number of small samples.  I decided on a combo so I could try a bunch of things.  I had the spicy black beans, pork fried rice, sweet pork and emerald chicken.  I sat down with my coworkers and we were presented with foil to go containers filled with food.  All my coworkers preferred the red jade chicken (sweet n sour).  I thought their Americanized Chinese food was pretty good and very interesting when combined with Mexican food.",positive

dnB7SD38_lwiC9E-BJxq-Q,"This place is so great I had to post my very first yelp review ever! The croissants are little pieces of art and are the best I have ever had!! The baked pies are just the right size and packed with filling! I walked in with my two little boys who wanted to try the colorful cosmic croissant ever since I brought home the ad. Once we walked in, however, they both quickly spotted the double chocolate chip cookies and went with that. I was a tad disappointed because I wanted that colorful croissant too. Everything is baked to order including the cookies. As we waited for our sandwiches and cookies a very sweet man came out of the kitchen with a cosmic croissant fresh from the oven. He had overhead our conversation about it being the draw to come in and he wanted us to try one on the house! That's customer service people! Great food, great staff and smiles on my little ones faces! We will be loyal customers for sure!",positive
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"Absolutely awful. I had the #7 & #6 with black beans and pork fried rice. My wife had the Chicken Diablo & the Jerk Chicken with black beans and regular rice. Mom had the Vegetarian Queso with black beans. It started off by my Mother asking ""Did anyone else get the black bean?"" I said, ""Why are they stone cold?"" All of our meals were barley warm at all. I don't know what the big deal is about this place. The parking lot was empty, the lighting was atrocious, and they strip mall area disserted. That should have been a sign (turn around and go somewhere else). The only reason that I gave them 1 Star is because I could not select 0 Stars! The Chocolate Cookie that came with the meal was the ""HIGHLIGHT"" of the night. Super soft, moist, and yummy. Very good cookie. Obviously it was bought/made somewhere else. This is by far the worst meal that I have had in sometime; so long I can't even remember having a meal this bad. The staff was nice and polite. They were somewhat helpful in trying to order. That in itself is a joke if you don't know what to expect.",negative
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"Staff was very friendly. They walked us through the menu and let us sample a few items before ordering. Order came out with Cuban black beans instead of the refried beans we ordered. They were ok but did not like the sweetness of them. Food was ok. Not bad. But not amazing either. The green sauce on the emerald chicken was good on its own but overpowered everything else on the plate. All I could taste and smell was the ginger. And I love ginger. The concept of ordering everything individually for a combo is nice, but once everything is piled on top of itself it is overwhelming. The snickerdoodle at the end was yummy though. It was worth a try but not sure I will be back.",positive

We had the Wok Wei dinner which comes with soup, appetizer, fried or steamed rice and one entrée for each person ordering.  Wow! the other reviews were not kidding the portion size was crazy big.  On the appetizer they give you egg roll, cheese puff, spare rib and fried shrimp, one each for each person, so we got two of each.  When she brought out the fried rice it was a huge plate, the entree sizes were nice too.  The service was fast and the food was great.  I agree with an earlier reviewer about the egg rolls, these were some of the best I have had.  The price for what you got was very reasonable.

l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"Frank and Eve (the owners), I hope you or someone who cares reads this!
This is a review of the Chandler location.

I've been a long time patron of Chino Bandido, starting with their first location at 19th Ave and Greenway in North Phoenix.
Quality, care and portions have always been the first priority.
My last three experiences with the Chandler location over the past 4 months have gotten progressively worse each time.
The most recent was this past Sunday evening around 6:30 for a carry out order.  The person who handled the order was very nice.  No issue here.  Although concern arose when she mentioned that the current kitchen staff was making the Egg Foo Yung we ordered for the first time.
The Egg Foo Yung ended up being the best part of the meal, as well as the complimentary Snicker Doodle cookie.
The Hengrenade Chicken was dry and leathery with little flavor left on or in it.  The Diablo chicken was also not their best effort, overcooked and dry as well.
The fried rice tasted as though it had been in a steam pan for hours...crunchy, dry and flavorless.  The kind of thing I might expect at the end of the night from a lesser establishment.
I'm not going to dwell on this, but unless some things change at the Chandler location, I really am not motivated to return at this point.
If I'm up North, I'll try the 19th Ave location in hopes that the same issues are not occurring there.
Frank and Eve (the owners) are wonderful people, so I am hopeful they take action and can get Chandler back to the really good Chinese /  Mexican fusion restaurant they once were.",positive

The service is incredibly slow and the waitresses are running around like crazy and in no way engage you. You have to grab them when they come by if you need anything. 

The food is very good. Portions are huge. Not big, but huge. I know how to throw down on some grub,  but the plates must've weighed 4lbs each. Appetizers are not needed. We ate the sampler, but after getting our meal we regretted it due to the amazingly large portions. 

Did I mention the service was non existent? Seriously...",positive
dnB7SD38_lwiC9E-BJxq-Q,Unbelievably delicious. Found this place through good reviews. All those 5 star reviews didn't steer me wrong. The shepherds pie was the best I've ever had. The caramelized croissant is addictive. This place is a must try.,positive

l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"Chino Bandido was featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. 

Probably one of the most interesting menu's that you will find. Chino Bandido's menu consists of Mexican, Chinese, and Caribbean choices and allows you to mix and match cuisine items. 

After seeing the Jade Red Chicken featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, I decided to go with it. I kept it simple and ordered a bowl of the Jade Red Chicken with white rice. 

The Jade Red sauce was very good and is the main reason that I rate Chino Bandido as above average. It had a sweet and slightly spicy flavor and is different then any sauce that I've ever tasted.

The service was fast enough, and some-what friendly and the prices were ok.

The tasty Jade Red sauce along with a very unique experience gives Chino Bandido and above average rating of four stars.",positive
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"I LOVE the food concept, their portions and have had great food almost every time I've been there. 

The only drawback is their ordering system. If you don't come often, it's hard to remember all the abbreviations and details needed for their ordering form. Their staff hasn't always been eager to make the ordering process easier either. 

Worth figuring out their system for the food though!",positive
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"I had high hopes for this place after seeing it on the food network and hearing good reviews from coworkers.

What we ate:
1. machaca burrito-according to my son this was one of the best burritos he has had in a while..it was $3.50 and he ate it in like 4 bites..a bit small.

2. Jade red pork quesadilla, jerk chicken, white rice- the rice was fine, the quesadilla only had a few pieces of pork and the chunks were huge and very very dry and tough. That jerk chicken was the most awful thing I have ever tasted !!!! that was not jerk chicken...it was soaked, dredged in nothing but black pepper, I almost choked. Jerk should be spicy and I am a fan of the spice, this was not edible in any way.

3. carnitas burrito, jade red chicken, jerk fried rice-the chicken was average, tasted like sweet and sour chicken, the jerk fried rice was almost as overpowering as the chicken, but edible. the carnitas was like no other we have ever seen...shredded beyond belief and a weird spinach flavor to it. we asked if spinach was in it and was told it was cilantro. The cilantro may have taken on a bitter flavor from being cooked for so long...whatever the case ...the flavor was just odd and had a horrible after taste for hours.

The staff were very nice and accomadating.

l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"I would have given this place one star, but the free cookie deserved an extra star.  The snickerdoodles are chewy and delicious.  As for the rest of the food, it was not worth the money or the calories.  We saw this place on an old episode of DDD and decided it was time we try it.  They make it look A LOT better on tv than it is in real life.  Two couples walked in after us and they both received food ten minutes before we received ours.

But everything else is great including the customer service and cleanliness!",positive
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"I have been going to the original location in Phoenix for the past 7 years so I was excited they opened up a location in Chandler. I can't believe some yelpers commented on the decor. This isn't, and never has been, a place you are going to bring your date to and order a bottle of wine at the table. It also isn't a place you are going to ask for the ""low fat, low calorie"" dish. Chino's is a fast food place with folding tables, no servers, your meal comes in a tin throwaway plate, plastic silverware, and plastic cups. You go for the food, which combines Mexican and Chinese flavors for an incredible taste! It may not sound like it would be good, but it is and it's worth checking out. 

Good points: 
The combination of Mexican and Chinese dishes is incredible to say the least! 
If it is your first time at Chino's, you can ask to sample the dishes for free. I highly recommend this so you won't be surprised on what you order. 
You always receive a free Snicker doodle (always freshly baked that day) cookie or a Volcano (chocolate fudge cookie on weekends). 
You can create your own meal with a lot of different dishes rather than just ordering one dish. 

Bad points: 
Only a few; the Chandler location is somewhat hard to find if you have never been there. It's tucked back in behind the Walgreens. Not that big of a deal as long as you know where you are going. 
It can be a bit confusing when ordering (you fill out a small form) but just ask for help when you get there. 

The dish I always order is the following: Hengrenade Chicken (go with the Pollo Diablo if you are looking for some kick) in a homemade quesadilla, a side of Jade Red Chicken (my favorite and most popular), a side of black beans (they blend the beans with other flavors in a soupy consistency, so don't expect anything different, and these are VERY good.) with Jerk Fried Rice. This is all around $10 with a drink and will fill you up, especially with the free cookie. 

This is one of my favorite places to eat for a good, gut busting meal. Give the stone Mexican panda in the restaurant a little touch for good luck.",positive
EAs61Wm1O6tLjCs8t2eP-Q,"This is our go to place for Chinese food. We absolutely love it!  The dinner combos are a lot of food for your money. I haven't tried anything that I did not like. My family loves the orange chicken and the sesame chicken. I like chicken and mushrooms, moo goo gai pan, and chicken and broccoli because of all of the fresh veggies they put in it like zucchini and carrots. This is the kind of Chinese food you eat, and you feel good after eating it. Not like places with all the greasiness. The staff is nice too.",positive
dnB7SD38_lwiC9E-BJxq-Q,"So the big question is: does Squarz live up to all the 5 star hype of fellow yelpers?!?!?

Unfortunately I do not believe so ... Thus far I would rate this cute spot a 3.5 - it was above average, but not amazing by any means.  I believe the reviews are too hyped up, and ultimately that is why I was a bit disappointed...

On my first visit I ordered:  

1)  the prosciutto, mozzarella, fig sandwich - it was good, but not great and surely fell short of excellent.  Maybe this was just a slip up with whoever sliced the prosciutto - it was sliced too thick ... The best way to serve prosciutto in a sandwich is layered paper thin, so that it melts in your mouth when you bite into it and essentially falls apart easily when chewed.  It was sliced way too thick for me, and it gave the sandwich a very chewy/rubbery like texture ... It could be great if my suggestion is applied and maybe the portion size increased a bit.  The side of an orange was kind of odd, but better than nothing I suppose. I would have preferred a small salad or maybe some sort of soup/sandwich combo.

2) the tomato soup was good, a nice sized portion, fairly priced, but let's face it ... It is tomato soup - it was good, but I've had better

3) I purchased a frozen bag of the chicken mushroom pot pies and warmed 3 up for dinner and they hit the spot.  They were quite tasty and probably the best thing I tried today ... I would rate them nearly a 4... Once again though, they were very good, but not so good that I would rave about them to my friends or family members.  But, it is pretty cool to be able to buy them frozen and bring them home to warm up and snack on them.  I would consider them more of a snack than an actual meal.

The atmosphere/ambiance:

ehhhh I would say is less than desirable ... It has very little seating and it's so tight in there I don't think I would ever want to eat in.  

It doesn't really resemble a bakery or cafe in my opinion ... In reality it's more of a pastry fast food type of establishment.  But there is nothing wrong with that if that is what they are going for ....

Would I visit again?? 

Yes, indeed - it is less than 2 miles from my house, so I will be back out of pure convenience... Not necessarily because the food was truly amazing.  But, it is definitely a better option than other local eateries.  Plus,  they do have great customer service, my food was promptly ready for me when I arrived, and the gentleman at the front counter was very pleasant and kind.  I found it to be rather odd that they were closed on Saturdays and Sundays though ... I would think this place would get the most business on the weekends... But hey what do I know? ;)",positive
EAs61Wm1O6tLjCs8t2eP-Q,Just discovered this great place for Asian food.  The service was super and the food was exceptional. We ended bringing a to-go box home and enjoyed it for lunch the next day!  We will go there again soon for dinner!,positive
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"Just had to try this place when I heard it was Asian-Mexican fusion and was featured on Triple-D with Guy Fieri. I will admit that I studied up beforehand, since some very resourceful Yelpers mentioned the complexity of the ordering system. It was worth walking through their ""How to Order"" demo on their website to know what to do.

The staff was extremely helpful when I approached the counter and volunteered that I was a Chino-Bandido virgin. They even provided tasting samples and suggestions that helped me understand what the different flavor profiles were. I settled on the combo (2 meat entrees, choice of beans, choice of rice) and chose Pollo Diablo (meat alone), Jen Red Pork (in a quesadilla), jerk fried rice and black beans. All were delicious and the servings generous. I dared not finish my quesadilla for fear the Oompah Loompahs would have to roll my fat ass out the door afterward.

I think there's a bit of a learning curve to eating here, but I enjoyed the unique dining experience. One of the staff even spotted my Chico State shirt and we instantly started chatting, since he was also from my neck of the woods (northern northern California, I like to call it). I learned that next time I'm going with the meat entrees as meat alone (as opposed to in a burrito or quesadilla), since there is more than enough of the sides to fill you up and the extra packaging only serves to mask the unique flavors of their savory meat choices.

I'll make a trip back, but I'm gonna save up some room first. The last meal resulted in a serious mid-afternoon lunch coma nap.",positive
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"Interesting  fusion concept.  I love Mexican and Chinese, so it was a no-brainer when I learned of this please via Guy Fieri's ""Diners, Drive-ins and Dives"" show.  It's been a few months since I tried, but I highly recommend this to anyone!",positive

The food was all fresh cooked to order. Seasoned just right, except for the egg rolls, which I thought were a bit too peppery. Overall, very delicious. My favorite was the fried shrimp. Not rubbery as most places serve it. Nothing tasted greasy, even the fried foods.

Large quantity served, so come hungry or prepare to take home lot's of leftovers. 

Our server was very sweet and got the order right. Kept our water and tea glasses full. 

They display an A rating from the health dept., and it shows. You can see the kitchen from the dining area, and it looks very clean.

Reasonable prices. We paid $40 for dinner for two, including tip, and we took home enough for another meal.

I had the chicken pot pie, which was really great--the crust was buttery and flaky, perfect--but my favorite thing was the Mac and cheese side.

The very last time I had dessert as good as this was during my travel in Rome, Italy few years ago....and I am so glad to have discovered this place in Arizona. I wasn't very excited to come here at first. Most American dessert tastes like nothing but s full mouth of sugar. Not this place!!!!! Between me and 3 others, we shared different pies and we cleaned them all. Their pies have just the right amount of sweet. It is flaky, tasty, and fresh off the oven (I could see it from where I sat). It isn't a big place with only few tables. Nevertheless, we still enjoy spending time at the corner for an hour. The owner is super nice, sweet and friendly towards us. He left us alone to hang out here, came around giving us refill for drinks and even gave us some extra pies that they bake an hour before closing time. We all left satisfied and happy.

There was a good portion of each, although I was looking forward to trying the lo mein and fried rice which are included in the combos. Not impressed at all.

l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"Here's the story, of some Chinese chicken... served with different styles of rice... all of them had different sauces, the lightest one not very Spicy.

Here's the story, of beans and burritos... some black beans, others refried. Both of them were very tasty, but also guaranteed to keep you on the pot all night.

So, this one day when the chicken met the beans and burritos... they knew that it was much more than a hunch... that this group should somehow join together, and that's the way they all became my greasy lunch.

While I was developing this article I tried to categorize Chino Bandido. I went back and forth between Mexican and Chinese over ten times before I just put it under both categories. However, Chino really isn't Chinese, Mexican, or Chinese-Mexican Fusion; it's really its own type of food. Speaking of Fusion, what the hell is that? The only Fusion that comes out of Chino Bandido is the mix of ethnic food in your stomach that will prohibit you from any sort of activity while it's digesting. Anyway, let's get into it.

Chino is nothing fancy. It's discreetly hidden behind a Walgreens off the main road. When you walk in you will notice that it is furnished with Costco folding tables and chairs, exposed duct work, concrete floor, and very little decoration on the walls except for an autographed Guy Fieri poster in the back. It's pretty simple. Gentleman, a word to the wise: don't expect to get laid if you bring a lady here on a first date.

As usual, I checked out Chino's menu on their website before I left the house. I'm no rocket scientist, but you need a quantum physics degree to figure out their ordering system. However, Chino has attempted to make ordering a bit easier by implementing ordering instructions and a simulator on their website. The staff at Chino's is awesome and will guide you through the ordering process and let you sample everything on the menu first anyway. If you read my previous post on Costco samples, you know that Chino giving samples wins hearts and minds in my book.

My first time at Chino I tried the Jade Red Chicken, the BBQ pork in a burrito, refried beans, and Jerk Fried Rice. The Jade red chicken was decent. It was like a General Tso's Chicken on steroids. A fried texture; super spicy and super sweet. The BBQ pork was alright but a little bland. While reading Yelp I remember running across someone's Yelp review that stated he loved the Jade Red Chicken so much that he was pissed off that the BBQ pork had to share the plate with it. Uh yeah, it didn't bother me that much. The Jerk fried rice was pretty good as well... it included jerk chicken and green onions. Chino's gets props for originality, giving you a lot of food, and making it easy to take home the leftovers. Once you slap on the cardboard lid you are all set to take it home and have it for breakfast the next day.

The best part about Chino Bandido (and best value) is the bonus they give you; the Snickerdoodle or Chocolate Volcano cookie (baked during weekends).

I opted for the Chocolate Volcano cookie and let me just say that thing was damn good. I will admit that the food was probably not enough to bring me back to Chino Bandido that often, but that cookie just might make it happen. And as for fusion, maybe next week I will try some Korean-Ethiopian-Chilean mix. You just never know.",positive
dnB7SD38_lwiC9E-BJxq-Q,Wow! My daughter and I just got back from lunch. 13 layers of pastry in a pot pie AND in a creme brule dessert. Really. You must go and try them! Inexpensive and they deliver! And SUPER nice people. This is what individual businesses should look like.,positive
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"Jade chicken, jerk fried rice... need I say more? If you can get passed the ""complicated"" way of ordering, then you will fall in love with this place. I don't even want to ruin it for you, just go here and try it out.",negative
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,Looks like a cafeteria. Cheap plastic tables and a printed paper menu on the wall. I was scared to eat there and walked out. They must have paid for ratings,positive
dnB7SD38_lwiC9E-BJxq-Q,"I don't even know where to start with this place! First off, my family use to own a restaurant so I usually set my standards for restaurants pretty high. I can say that this place absolutely exceeded every expectation and standard! The food is DELICIOUS. It's warm and fresh, and the croissant is beyond flakey and it melts in your mouth!! As far as the owner goes, I have never recieve such amazing customer service. You can tell he has a passion for what he does, and that he genuinely loves his customers and appreciates them! I can't wait to come back again next week!!! You have to try this place. The chicken pot pie is amazing, and the shepherd's pie....pure HEAVEN! Fresh squeezed lemonade is a delicious touch, as well!",positive
EAs61Wm1O6tLjCs8t2eP-Q,My daughter said to give them a 4.5. We found this place on yelp at the last minute. The food was fresh and delicious! The portion sizes are pretty good. You could definitely split an entree combo between two people. We will be returning here again!,positive
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"Wow, way overrated, but not really a bad place either.. I received so much HYPE about how GREAT this place was, and people went into the Diners Dives n Drive thru's, which for me was a selling point to try. Great concept though, a mix of 3 culture to quench most cravings. I got the Chinese BBQ Pork (Great) and the Jerk Chicken (fair) with the beans n rice... Rice was a tad undercooked, and the Jerk chicken lacked the JERK from other Caribbean food I have tried..",positive
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"Totally awesome! Seriously, you gotta try this place. You don't HAVE to mix things, but it is definitely encouraged: Jade and red chicken with jerk fried rice is like sticking your toes in the water. Don't forget your cookie for dessert (or later!).

Once you fall in love with this place and want to try something different, order an egg foo yung quesadilla.",positive
EAs61Wm1O6tLjCs8t2eP-Q,"Typical, charges us a 18% gratuity for my wife, friend, 2 kids and I.  Will never even think about coming back here! 18% for what. 18% for 5 and more. Ridiculous",positive
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"I can remember eating at Chino Bandido ever since I was a kid. I always went to the original location on the west side on Greenway. My favorite has always been the Jade Red Chicken, Egg Foo Young, and Chile Relleno. The black beans are also my beans of choice. If you manage to be at the restaurant when they're serving the volcano cookies, consider yourself lucky. I've always hoped I'd be there when they serve those but I always end up with the snickerdoodles. Which are good as well, but the volcano cookies are wayyy better.",positive
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"So freaked out right now. We asked for a lime with the corona and after working the register, he grabbed the limes with his dirty fingers. After the chef heard that we put a happy hour order in, he screamed 'no more happy hour' and started banging things around. Then the order came out with refried beans instead of black beans. Fly's are buzzing all around our food. I am too freaked out to eat this and just spent  $17.46. Should I risk it, and try this food?",positive
EAs61Wm1O6tLjCs8t2eP-Q,Went in for lunch special of General Tsos chicken....I dont know what's changed but it tastes like shit! The dish is supposed to have chicken..its nothing bit balls of flour tossed in the sauce. The rice is supposed to be fried rice....its white rice colored brown with who knows what. I'm disappointed and will not be returning ever again to this place. AJK is way better than this.,negative
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,We are a divided family on this one. Husband likes it. Wife--not so much. Wife is writing this review. Our favorite is their egg foo young and Snickerdoodle cookies. Sometimes it's good; sometimes is sucks--cookies included. Check take-out orders carefully. Not always correct. I usually recommend eating here when I'm not hungry.,positive
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"Interesting asian/mexican fusion theme but taste is just ok. Great place to go if you just want to fill your stomach for a cheap price.

Best part about it is the snicker doodle they give you with the meal.

Ordering is kind of odd but nice that you can make anything a burrito, quesadilla or just eat it alone for all the same price.

Place is bare bones, with cafeteria type tables/benches.",positive
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"Miss this place. Used to work in the computer repair store next to Walgreen's and this was an amazing place for lunch. Disappointed, but I will make the haul to PHX for Chino.",negative
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"Okaaay, so my fiance really wanted to go here for dinner last night, but I was weary, sounded really greasy. So I talked him into something else, then  again today, pleeeease, Chino Tori? Fine, I gave in. 

I'll give this to Chino, it's an original idea. Mexican, Jamaican and Chinese fusion, but it's not executed well at all. Like someone said before, the whole ordering process, especially for first timers needs to somehow be streamlined, it's ridiculous, like they need a help desk or something. But part of the initiation is you get to taste test before ordering, so I guess that is good.  The location is waaaay back in this weird building, and weird weird, not weird good. There is also way too much space inside, gives it a very cafeteria feel. 

Now to the food...the jerk chicken Chris ordered was pretty good, as was his sweet n sour chicken and rice. My lunch on the other hand was a disaster, so I ate half of his. I ordered the emerald chicken, then I get the choice of being served over rice or in a quesidilla, I chose the dilla. Well, that was the wrong choice. See the pic I posted, my quesidilla was glistening!! We could not eat it. It was in a pool of grease. Gross.

So Chino, I have some ideas for ya. Get it together, this is a cool concept, but learn how to make your food consistently good, maybe toasting the quesidillas instead of frying? Hire a professional to look at your menu and give suggestions for prep. Second, the ordering system needs attention, it's confusing. Thirdly, the space is weird and desolate, some interior changes would be a good thing.",positive
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"The food tasted great and I loved the decor.  They have a 12,000 lb black granite panda wearing a sombrero.  That was too cool.  The food was great and not expensive, but the menu was a disaster and you had to study how to write in the proper codes before you could order.  This really wasn't needed as we were the only people in line.  Also I got sick after eating this junk, it only last for ~4hours but it still sucked.",positive
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"There are 2 loves in my life and they are Chinese food and Mexican food. To think they fused both into one delicious delight makes me believe they built this place in honor of me.

It's a great little fast food place with pretty good portions. The menu itself is a little confusing. There is too many acronyms and too much writing involved. I just wanna eat! Their signature dish is the jade chicken which is kinda like a Mexican style orange chicken. Pretty good i would have to say. The Jerk Chicken packs a punch with its kick of spiciness. The rice served with it is a little dry and it's no bueno to eat dry food and spicy food together, but still delicious overall.

If they had one of these in LA i would go all the time. Great food, great prices, great portions. Fast food at its best.",positive
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"Let's admit it: this place is neither Chinese nor Mexican.  Not that I have a problem with that.  I just see it as another Panda Express or Baja Fresh - good ole American fast food.  I have been here twice and the food has been good both times.  I have now tried: jade red chicken, emerald chicken, machaca, carnitas, cuban black beans, refried beans, and pork fried rice.  My favorites are the jade red chicken and pork fried rice.  On my second visit, the food was a little salty, but again, this is American fast food.  The snickerdoodle cookie is also a nice touch.  I need to be sure to make it one day for their volcano cookie.  Portions are big enough to have leftovers for another meal.  This is granted that I always pick quesadilla for one of my combo choices.  Service has been good on both visits even though all the workers seem a little young.  They were friendly, helped with the menu, and gave samples for first timers.  I have to admit, $10 for a combo + drink is high for a fast food joint, but somehow, I know I will be going back.  Oh yeah, for $10, they can do better than plastic lawn chairs and tables.",positive
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"So my bf and I went to the new location in Chandler. It was set back from the road and slightly hidden, so it was a bit hard to find. The inside is huge. Like a warehouse. The walls were lined with plastic outdoor tables and chairs. Kind of weird but whatever. The food was INTERESTING. Some of the things I tried were good and some were not so good. 
I had the Red Chicken, Diablo quesadilla and Jerk Fried Rice. The Diablo chicken was incredibly salty and greasy. I would not order it again. The Red Chicken was bomb! And the Jerk Chicken alone was amazing. I also tasted the Emerald Chicken and that was good, but weird.
My bf loved the Jerk Chicken and the Red Chicken. I would definitely go back and try more things. I love the variety. And for the price it's a really great deal. You get a lot of food and a drink for about $10! If you are looking for something cheap with lots of options then I would recommend it! If your mom is in town visiting, take her somewhere a bit nicer.",positive
dnB7SD38_lwiC9E-BJxq-Q,"Love supporting small businesses and I'm so glad I found this little place to do so! 
Food is delicious, I tried a little.of everything and these pastries are on point. 
I enjoyed it all, even the mac and cheese! 
The owner is a sweetheart as well and was there working alone on a Friday night! That's some great commitment and I will be back for sure!",positive
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"Been here numerous times, and usually I'd rate them a 4 out of 5.  Lately, however, it appears that management is never on duty.  They are slow and inattentive.  

I had called ahead with a large party of around 20 people nearly a week in advance, and again a few hours before our alotted time.  Upon arrival, our tables were neatly set aside and marked as reserved.  However, a few cooks didn't show up for work, or management just didn't see the point in having more than two on a Saturday night.  It took an hour for us to get our food.  AN HOUR!

The place was slammed, which is good for them, but we watched as more customers ended up leaving instead of staying and waiting over an hour for their food.  The wait was ridiculous, especially since we arrived at our scheduled time with the number of people we said we would have.  

I've never been to the original Chino Bandido, but apparently this one isn't able to accomodate groups of any size in a reasonable time period.  This was the second time we brought our group to Chino, and I guarantee it was the last.",positive
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"So I've been going to this Chino Bandido place off and
on for a number of years. Great concept - Chinese/Mexican
(Con)fusion without any pretense. At the original location
by the horsey races they give Chino Bandido virgins the
whole flavor sample deal - you almost get a full meal just
trying all the different possible fillings. So in this
Chandler location I didn't notice that whole ritual. It
is more of just figure out what you want and fill out the order
sheet. 
   The order sheet seems to trip up a lot of folks.
It ain't rocket science or quantum finance, folks. Don't
even look at the sheet. Figure out what you want to eat
first and then look at the sheet (see photo) and figure out 
how to express that. 
  It's easy. You get 14 items to choose from: Carnitas, Chile
Relleno, Chinese BBQ Pork, Egg Foo Yung, Gringo Chicken, Hengrenade
Chicken, Jade Red Chicken, Jen Red Pork, Jerk Chicken, Emerald
Chicken, Teriyaki Chicken, Veggie Salad, Pollo Diablo, and Machaca.
Got all that? Now you can choose to get this as a rice bowl, 
combination, Quesadilla, or Burrito. 
   For the rice bowl, you just choose one item with steamed rice or
optional beans as well. You can also add fried rice for 75 cents.
   For the combo, you can choose two different items (it says 1-20 
but I think they meant 14) and circle either BLK for Black or REF for 
refried beans. Then you also choose what type of fried rice you want. 
JFR for Jerk Fried Rice, CFR for Chicken Fried Rice, PKFR for pork 
fried rice, and PLFR for plain fried rice. This is pretty much the 
full-on big plate. You can also get the items in either a burrito or 
a quesadilla by specifying a Q or B. This way you get a burrito or
quesadilla in addition to your fried rice and beans. 
   You can also get items as Quesadillas. You can mix more than one
item together if you're daring. Same with the burritos. 
   You can also order the rice and beans as a separate side if you 
didn't get the rice bowl or combo and wanted it anyway. You can get
it as a pint or quart as well if you want to take some home.
   Finally, the cookies. You get a free cookie anyway but if one ain't
enough they have a space for you to order half a dozen or a dozen.
   Drinks - pretty much self explanatory. I like this place. I don't need
an endorsement by Guy Fieri to justify my liking this place. This is 
an occasional lunch outing with co-workers when the mood strikes. Lately
I've just been getting Quesadillas and Burritos and skipping the whole
rice and beans thing. I don't need to fall asleep in any meetings thank
you. :) One thing about this location - even though you don't need 
higher education to fill out the order form you might still need a 
sextant, compass, telescope, and charts to find the place. The Google
map makes it look like it is right on Chandler but it's deep southeast 
into the mall. Lots of parking but not necessarily right next to the
place during the lunch rush.",positive
dnB7SD38_lwiC9E-BJxq-Q,"Everything is made as squares. The croissant was buttery and tasty. I also tried one of the spinach pies, not as flavorful, but still good! Staff is helpful and friendly",positive
EAs61Wm1O6tLjCs8t2eP-Q,"Great location in Goodyear. Restaurant was clean indoors and outdoors. We were seated right away by a young waitress who was very quick, kind and zero mistake. My girl ordered veggie fried rice and veggie lo mein. She also had my egg drop soup and liked it. She was very satisfied!

For an appetizer, I ordered pan fried chicken potstickers. The potstickers were average. They weren't as juicy, tender and warm as expected. For my main entree, I got the orange chicken dinner combo which came with fried rice, lo mein, one egg roll and two crab puffs. All were delicious. The orange chicken is thinly sliced and the sauce is uniquely delicious. The lo mein has the be the best I've had, EVER!

Staff works hard here and their proud of he business. I will definitely come back!",positive
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,"Chino Bandido is the best of... the best of it's kind. As a restaurant/eatery that fuses chinese, mexican and jamaican all into the same metal dish to-go, Chino Bandido is a unique Phoenician experience. While you will not get any sort of memorable experience from the decor, what you will remember is the intricate coded system of ordering from their enigma-menu, and the way your dish looks when it comes out with mexican beans, jerk chicken, red jade pork, and fried rice. If you love the basic combination of Meat + Rice, this is heaven.

If you want Jamaican jerk chicken and pork fried rice thrown into a burrito - do it.

You can look at the overhead board menu and choose from the basic options, but the real Chino Bandido experience occurs when you take a second to learn the menu code, and create your own combo. Choose two numbers 1-12 as meat, then either black or refried beans, then from a selection of rice - pork, chicken, fried, jerk, spanish - oh, and if you want it just thrown into the metal tin, or prepared as a burrito or quesadilla... Yeah, don't just order the #2. Make something your own.

The space is nearly as large as a school cafeteria and the tables would fit perfectly in that setting. Grab a pen and menu from the ordering counter and sit down with your party while you fill it out neatly and circle the items you want. Hand it over when you order and that's it. They'll decipher the code and bring you your food.

The Chandler location has free WiFi, and you'll see a good number of IT personnel at lunch, sitting with their laptops and 'working'.

The food at Chino Bandido is really good. Especially for how much you get for the low price. There isn't anything like this anywhere else in Phoenix. While some describe this as a 'fusion' of the three types of food, it's honestly not that. Just because you throw them in the same bowl, that doesn't make it fusion. Chino Bandido fulfills cravings, all of them, all at once. Want chinese or mexican or a little jamaican? Right now? Okay! Go here. Although not better than most actual restaurants, Chino Bandido is definitely better than most fast lunch spots. I could seriously eat here everyday for a few months and not have the same dish.

As far as a uniquely Phoenix experience, it is that, but it's not a must. When they start to actually create items and mashing things together... then it'll be a Phoenix Must. Until then, it's just one of the best quick lunches you can get.",positive
