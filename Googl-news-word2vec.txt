We are going to use googleâ€™s pre-trained model. It contains word vectors for a vocabulary of 3 million words trained on around 100 billion words from the google news dataset. The downlaod link for the model is this. Beware it is a 1.5 GB download

from gensim.models import Word2Vec

#loading the downloaded model
model = Word2Vec.load_word2vec_format('GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin', binary=True, norm_only=True)

#the model is loaded. It can be used to perform all of the tasks mentioned above.

# getting word vectors of a word
dog = model['dog']

#performing king queen magic
print(model.most_similar(positive=['woman', 'king'], negative=['man']))

#picking odd one out
print(model.doesnt_match("breakfast cereal dinner lunch".split()))

#printing similarity index
print(model.similarity('woman', 'man'))
