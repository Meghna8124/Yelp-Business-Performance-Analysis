0,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"The food here is great and so is the friendly staff. Ling and Louie's has everything going for it except the feeling of an Asian restaurant as it's a mix of Southwestern influences...Nothing wrong with that..just not plain Asian..

There are a couple of great choices on the menu especially the Evil Jungle Princess and the chicken and rice soup, and some of the appetizers are downright killers sch as the chicken lettuce cups and the chicken skewers.
.
A word on Houston; the bartender...that guy is bad ass in every sense of  the words...it's just not the same when he is not there...He is cordial, warm, friendly, fuzzy, extremely kind and just a real pro..I can't say enough nice things about him and even the other bartenders there cannot measure up to him...

My first review of Ling and Louie's was a little harsh at first but all my experiences since then have been consistently excellent. The management is top notch and never afraid of any criticism nor to make up for it...

Upgrading my review to four stars because Yay I'm a fan and yes they deserve it..."
1,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"Ling & Louie, hmmm, I'm having a bit of hard time to define this place. The menu serves a wide range of Asian foods, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai and Vietnamese (from my first glance of the dishes and its names), then there is a full bar, Happy Hour menu such as Asian fusion 'flatbread' and 'tacos', it just made me more confused, a place serves many kinds of Asian food but nothing is specialized? Just because you put a description of 'asian sauce', makes a taco Chinese? Then there is this interesting looking clock on the wall next to the kitchen, a clock consists '12' on the top as normal, but the rest numbers are replace by a '5', that just made you start singing, 'it is five o'clock somewhere', and 'let's drink'! So yeah, this is a bar with many kinds of Asian fusion foods. Do not come if you are craving for a more authentic asian cuisine, that was my mistake, yeah..."
2,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"Last Sunday was our first time at this Asian Grill.  All the beef dishes are made with Filet Mignon. My 81 year young Mother ordered the Mongolian beef and had ""zero"" complaints! What a wonderful concept to use such tender beef since it has to be sliced thin for Asian recipes. The entrees are served over rice instead of on the side. If your used to rice on side they will accommodate your request when ordering. For appetizers, the spicy calamari was a hit with our group of five.  This is served over the best tasting chili asian slaw. It was a hit with our middle schooler too. So were the Siamese spring rolls served with a sweet chili sauce. One order of each appetizers were plenty to share around the table. The miso soup (this was our first) was a dark, mild fishy broth...not our favorite...must be an acquired taste. The Sizzling Blackened Chicken and Pork was cooked in a red curry butter which was mild in flavor.  The meat was tender. Try the wasabi mashed potatoes as an extra side dish...yum! The Buddha's Feast with Chicken was not a favorite. The menu states with a hint of Thai basil though the sauce was over powered with to much basil.  For the lighter diners try the combo Ling Chicken and Rice soup served with Chopstick Chicken salad. The salad dressing is a sesame soy vinaigrette. We certainly enjoyed our food and will return to Ling and Louie's."
3,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"Great food - two favorites by far are the Evil Jungle Princess (w/ fillet Mignon & noodles) and the sizzling blackened chicken and pork. The flavor is unreal - they know what they are doing. Everyone comments about how it's not ""real"" Chinese food but I am telling you - it's better. Don't waste your time or money at Flo's or Jade, I have eaten all three many times and Ling is hands down better tasting food."
4,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"Always great food and service. Bar staff is fantastic. I love this restaurant. I would recommend if you haven't tried before, that you stop by!"
5,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"Had dinner here last week with some friends on the recommendation of others in our condo. Nice outdoor patio. Lettuce wraps and a sushi roll for appetizers. Food was good as well as the service. Will be back next time for happy hour! $5 apps along with beer, wine and cocktail specials. 

For dinner we had pad Thai, surf and turf, salmon and chicken cashew stir fry.  I asked for the chicken stir fry to be a little spicy...it was a lot spicy, so be careful with that request!  Others said their meals were good and there were some comments the appetizers were the best!  I agree!"
6,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"Great service and a fun menu! 
Our waitress made her favorite suggestions which we appreciated as it was our first visit there.
It's a must try!!"
7,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"I'm not grading this on authenticity... just on taste and value.  As Scottsdale das developed and evolved the hipper cooler places have moved north.  After several places closed between 2008 and 2010, good food was getting harder and harder to find in 85259.   L&Ls has great tasting food, love the Mongolian beef flat-bread and the Honey Walnut Chicken.   The service is excellent and location is great.  Adequate parking and not far from 101 but not buried around 90th and 92nd St.

And Carol, the meatloaf is probably only on the menu for kids (or adults) who choose something safe sounding... don't think its fair to grade them on meatloaf...  I don't critic meatloaf (even when it just 3 stars) on a Asian/fusion/whatever-it-is menu!

For a full menu go here: http://scottsdale.lingandlouies.com/wp-content/themes/WP_Theme_LandL_Scottsdale/images/menu-dinner.pdf"
8,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"Fun place,  great HH prices,  and Ashley was an awesome bartender. It was close to closing time and she made sure everyone was taken care of. She wasn't concerned about trying to rush everyone along so she could go home. We will definitely be back."
9,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"A great classic local place with top service and consistently great food ... If they offered Beefeaters it would be perfect, but five stars non-the less..."
10,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,I remember it being really good even though the prices were a little high.  I was asked to suggest a restaurant for a family get together with out of town relatives.  We all agreed on L&L.  Reservations were made.  When we showed up there the place was closed with a note saying they decided to close on Superbowl Sunday.  Not nice having cousins showing up from all parts of the valley and out of town.  They had a contact number.  Why did they accept the reservation and then not contact to inform us they would be closed?  Bad business.
11,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"I dined at Ling & Louie's on a Friday night. The place was mobbed and I had to wait 1/2 hour for a deuce to open up. They seat people that call in and say they'll be right over first before they seat live body walk-ins. Now that I know the lay of the land I'll be prepared for next time.

There will be a next time because the food and the service rocks. It's hard to believe this restaurant is at 3 1/2 stars on Yelp given all the people who showed up this past Friday. My wife and I started off with the rice and chicken soup. What surprised me was that there was hardly any rice in the soup but plenty of chicken. The soup was too peppery plus there was another spice in there that I couldn't put my finger on. So the soup was a solid 2.5 to 3 stars. 

Now for the main course, I ordered the Kung Pow Beef and my wife had the Thai Pad. The Kung Pow Beef consisted of filet minon, broccoli, green onions, bell peppers and hot peppers over rice. I definitely enjoyed this dish. My plate was piled high with delicious food and had a flavorable spicy kick to it. I would definitely order this dish on subsequent visits. My wife enjoyed the Thai Pad and was definitely happy that she had plenty of leftovers for subsequent lunches. Again, very generous portions for this entree.

I can't wait to try out the rest of the menu, this place definitely is head and shoulders above it's competitors such as Flo's and PF Chang because the food definitely tastes better."
12,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,Went for lunch and had the BBQ Chicken Flatbread- it was delicious! Everyone at our table enjoyed their food and I would return again to try more on the menu
13,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"This is my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale.  The food is exceptionally good and very fresh and full of strong flavor.  I describe this cuisine as Americanized Asian food.  I like that they offer an option of brown rice with all the meals, and you can substitute most of the meats for tofu if you like that.  The Evil Jungle Princess is my absolute favorite.  A sweet and spicy peanut sauce on top of chicken, mushrooms, onions, and crispy fresh green beens that are cooked just the right amount so they snap when you bite into them.  I also love the Wango Mango chicken with big chunks of mango.  Everyone always loves the New Wave Pad Thai.  The Teriyaki Salmon is cooked to perfection, on top of a bed of wasabi mashed potatoes and green beens.  The Firecracker chicken tastes like wing sauce, so if you like wing sauce you will like this.  Otherwise you might want to pass.  The best part of this restaurant is the kids meals.  They serve them in a Bento Box, with little square compartments for each portion of the meal.  It's a great value that comes with a main dish of either noodles and chicken or wonton chicken, and edamame, and fried wontons with sweet and sour sauce, and a whole large bag of M&Ms, that the waiter was smart enough to secretly hand me on the side instead of serving it up with the rest of the meal."
14,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"I enjoy Asian fusion, but this was disappointing.  First, we had to wait 25 minutes to be seated. Which would be fine if it was worth that wait...
Started with a cocktali which was highly recommended by the waitress. Shanghai Tea or something like that? It was nothing special.
We ordered some Edamame to start, and it never came. I guess someone forgot. Very unfortunately considering how hungry we were.

I had the orange chicken, which was okay. It was too salty,didn't really taste like orange chicken so much as salt chicken... so I wouldn't get it again. My husband got the Evil Jungle Princess Chicken and he didn't seem blown away by it. I tasted it and it was not that flavorful.
Dessert was probably the best part. We got the banana spring roll, and it was pretty tasty. 
I don't think we will bother going back."
15,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"Loved it!  Half expected a lame PF Chang wannabe so was very surprised at how excellent and fun it was!  Specials were terrific and cheap, and the bartender Paul made us some of the better drinks I've had in town."
16,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,Worse than pei Wei.  That's saying a lot.  I had it awhile again and tried Ling and Louie's again hoping it would be different. Nope. Food came out like a mush and was bland.   The honey Walnut shrimp was like honey Walmart shrimp.  Tastes like it had been microwaved. I had two bites of my wife's evil princess whatever and spit it out. Even the crab rangoons were oily.   Never again. And for comparison sake it was worse than last time.
17,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"The first time I ate here, I had the Firecracker Chicken Tacos and I've been addicted ever since.  It's what I always get.  I'm not usually into spicy food, and these are just right- a little spicy, but not so spicy I can't stand it.  I think the Bleu Cheese gives it a unique flavor for a taco, and all around these things are just too good.

I also love their crab puffs... real crab and tons of cheese!  So, so yum!  

I just wish they'd bring back the duck flat bread... that thing was really delicious too.

If you eat in, be prepared because I have never, ever seen this restaurant quiet or empty, except for right after they open.  Otherwise, it is hopping and there's usually quite a few people waiting for tables... but it is totally worth it.   Their outside seating is really nice, and they do have heaters for those brief times it gets slightly chilly here :D"
18,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"Had dinner there again yesterday.  The staff is so nice!  (Houston, Steve, Tanner) and the food is consistent and always fresh!  The Thai Mai is killer, but still want my fav spiced Rum - Sailor Jerry's!  This is a great place for happy hour, or any hour!  And bring your friends!!!!"
19,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,Food: Just another Pei Wei. This is not chinese food and it is drowned in salty sauce.  Service: friendly but only one waiter on a Sunday just couldn't keep up.
20,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"I love this place. Their service is friendly and everything I've tried on the menu for the last 2.5 years has been great. The calamari appetizer, half price at happy hour, is the best calamari in the country. And my airline pilot husband and I have traveled and eaten out a whole lot in the last 30 years. Our college student son likes the food as well. The Asian fusion cuisine works. You'll love it."
21,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"Best Asian restaurant in Scottsdale!! The food is spectacular, and the service is ALWAYS on point!! My wife and I go there at least once a week, and we always have a wonderful experience!! If you haven't been there yet...you'd be a fool to not check it out!! Ask for Marcus...he's the best! (Although the whole staff is really good!)"
22,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"Well, this is one of those ratings that I wish I could give an extra 1/2 star on, because a 2-star can be deceiving.

This place is very well decorated, and the personality of the servers is very friendly.

The only problem is the food.

I don't really care how good the service is, or how fun the atmosphere is, if a restaurant doesn't have good food, most other categories don't matter.

The Pomegranate tea I had tasted very watered down, and the Firecracker chicken I had (which was highly recommended by the waitress) tasted a lot like a frozen dinner over mildly overdone rice. The sauce was bland, and the chicken was dry and tasteless.

It might pass for somebody unfamiliar with Asian food.

I was pretty surprised, because the shrimp appetizer we had was VERY tasty.

Too bad. I don't expect I'll be back unless my coworkers outnumber me."
23,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,This place was nice.  maybe a little pricey but we all had a good time. I recommend it.
24,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,A great spot for Happy Hour!  You can't go wrong with their Tai Mai and many other Cocktail specials!  They also have some fun apps to pair with your dinner.
25,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"My wife and I love this place. It is always good food and the price is just right. 

We love the pad thai. So flavorsome. The meatloaf is great. It has such a great meaty flavor with that sweet vinegary glaze.

For lighter fare try the chopped chicken salad. 

The drinks are very inventive."
26,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"Typical casual dining fake asian food.

Five spieces edamame- super excited about this because it was free with a foursquare check in and I'm a cheap asian, but it was cheap anyway especially during their everlasting happy hour
Black orchid ahi- really mediocre, the soy sauce that came with was gross
Evil jungle princess with chicken- completely overrated, basically a huge bowl of generic sauce and oil dump"
27,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"Upscale, modern appearance and progressive with some really very unique dishes and specials. They have a variety of unique dishes and wines. Handled a group of 10 with no problems. Delicious food, great service and atmosphere, we will most certainly return on our next visit."
28,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,We eat here sometimes twice a week.  Always great food and excellent service.  The quality of the beef in all the dishes is amazing!
29,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"Second visit to L&L.  The first was at lunch with a group of moms second with my family.  The service was excellent which is saying a lot.  They didn't have to ask what we needed they surveyed the table and kept the meal moving.  Which I appreciated since we had the three kids with us.  This is not traditional chinese, so get the asian nachos.  They are a giant appetizer very unique and quite tasty.  EVERYONE enjoyed their meals and the happy hour deals are pretty good.  I see more visits in my future."
30,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"Consistently good; love, love the honey walnut shrimp over brown rice (hold mushrooms), yummy."
31,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"I went here recently with my family. Being seated in a booth, I have to say my first impression of the place was not great. It's never a good thing when restaurant booths are set up in a claustrophobia-inducing style, with the tables and seats so crammed together that the tabletop is way too close to your body. 

I followed the Yelp app announcement and signed up for their email list in order to get the free lettuce wrap appetizer, which was decent. For my entree I ordered the Evil Jungle Princess with shrimp and fried rice. It sounded really tasty on the menu, but the dish ended up being very bland, and it all seemed kind of... mushy or overcooked. It wasn't the worst thing I've ever eaten, but I would not order it again.

Our server seemed friendly but wasn't the most attentive. My mom was waiting to get her water glass refilled for quite a while, and ended up just flagging down a different server. Overall not impressed with this place."
32,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"I did not eat here. Because the service was so poor. 
I went to the bar. Sat there for about 5 to 10 min. The persons behind the bar. Wakes back and fourth in front of me 4 times and never said a word. Than went back to the other end of the bar to grab a bill. Waked back across in front of me and went to check on a table and still no greeting or anything. I left and went to stone and vine where the food and service was fantastic. 
At 6ft 200lb it was the first time I felt invisible."
33,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"When looking for a new place to try I always try to scope out the menu before going.  The menu at Ling & Louie's has some awesome looking items on it.  When we first entered the restaurant there were no employees around to greet us.  It was initially confusing on whether we had to seat ourselves or wait for a host/hostess.  Finally someone walked up and greeted us and took us to our seats.  The server was pleasant and explained the restaurant well.  We ended up ordering the hand-wrapped potstickers, lettuce wraps, new wave pad thai, and miso soup.  I also had a ginger-lime margarita and 22oz Ling's lager.

The food was EXTREMELY disappointing.  The potstickers were by far the best of the items we ordered.  The lettuce wraps (not the lettuce) and the pad thai tasted so strongly of GAS from the wok that it was very difficult to swallow.  The pad thai was lacking flavor and spice and was just so overpowered by gas from the wok that any other flavors it may have had were unnoticeable.  This goes for the lettuce wraps as well; the lettuce they use is fine, however the chicken mix they wok'd was so gassy tasting that my wife struggled to finish it as well.  The miso soup was equally terrible as it was full of thin stringed seaweed.  Miso soup should not have more seaweed than liquid.  It was awful.

To top it off, I ordered my 22oz lager in hopes of having something to wash down the gas after-taste we were suffering through.  I received my beer 16 MINUTES after ordering it, and the bar was NOT busy, as this was a Wednesday night.  That to me is just unacceptable.  Drinks should be the quickest and easiest thing to get customers.

This restaurant receives 2 stars for good potstickers, and a good margarita, subpar overall service, and lackluster food.  If you like your wok'd food tasting primarily like GAS then this is the place for you!  Just not for us.."
34,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,A favorite of ours for birthdays and special occasions. The Evil Jungle Princess Beef is my go to dish!
35,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"Classic case of a good thing going south... or something like that. Always great food, but time and again they just can't get the execution down. Service just slips more and more seemingly every visit. Gotta get that right."
36,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,Great food and great feel! Just moved to the condos across the street from here and I love this place!
37,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,Cool little spot right in a little shopping center with a few other nice restaurants and bars. They do Asian fusion food have some interesting drinks and appetizers. & a good happy hour.
38,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"First let me state that the only reason I am deducting a star is because I didn't like the entree that I ordered, but due to the fact that the quality of the food was great I would return to try a different entree on the menu. I also really enjoyed their lettuce wraps, so that would bring me back again. :) 

The service here is amazing! Our waitress, I believe her name was Ashley (cute blonde girl) did a fantastic job! She was professional, knowledgeable, and personable. The manager was also great... He came to see how everything was, gave us a coupon and invited us back. 

The atmosphere was very modern, cute, laid back and fun. 

I really enjoyed my experience here and as I stated previously, I would return to try something different on the menu! :)"
39,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,Place has a line out the door. Which tells you something.  Their soap and salads are scrumptious. Portion sizes are enough for leftovers.  Pricing is reasonable for the excellent quality. Highly recommend.
40,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"My friend and I went here Friday night for dinner.  It's one of her favorite restaurants, and I had never been before.  We sat outside, and had no trouble getting a table.  

I ordered the Korean Salmon which came sizzling with asparagus underneath it.  The salmon was cooked perfectly!!!  I was so impressed!  And, it was delicious!  I asked for brown rice with it, which I would recommend doing.

It was a great evening with a great meal!"
41,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"I wanna steal the manager who is on TV all the time to be a chef in my restaurant ;) The bathrooms are awesome and clean, and that is how one REALLY knows if a restaurant is good. Great food, big smiles, sumptuous drinks...what more can you ask for?"
42,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"I'm giving 2 stars for the kids menu, which is very good compared to others we have seen. But when it comes to the regular menu I was very disappointed tonight. In the past, I would have given Ling &  Louie's 3.5-4 stars, always pretty good and a satisfying meal. However, they have changed the menu since the last time we have been and I don't know if that means things changed in the kitchen!?! 
We started with an appetizer from the ""featured"" Vietnam menu, Summer Rolls $10.95, which I feel were worth $3.95 from a grocery store cold bar :( about 3-4 small pieces of shrimp with some veggies, very bland, and the sauce served next to them added nothing unfortunately. I ordered the Cashew Chicken Stir Fry and my husband the Mongolian Chicken. I again felt like it was something I could have ordered from a fast good Chinese restaurant, not terrible, but not what I would have expected from Ling & Louie's - same went for my husband. Not what we have experienced in the past from here. 
Bottom line, food was mediocre at best and not sure with their prices that we will back now (which is disappointing since it used to be one of our go to places for Asian cuisine that pleased everyone). We defiantly don't mind spending $ for good cuisine but now would rather drive a little further and spend it elsewhere. :-/"
43,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"Went here yesterday for lunch, arrived at 1145ish and sat at the bar. There were two others sitting when I arrived. I sat there for 15 mins while the bar tender did not even greet me. I had to get my own menu from the wall right as you walk in, and the only way I knew where they were is because I saw 4 parties get sat and that's where the servers were pulling the menus. I was finally acknowledged after I had my menus. I then asked for an Iced tea, and it looked like I was bothering him for asking. Again it was about another 5 mins before I received my tea. He was too busy dealing with take out orders, and seating other people as they walked in. It was about another 5 mins to place my order and when I did he looked at me and said I drank my tea to quickly. Who says that? To top it all off there was a lady that walked in a few moments after I received my food and sat at the other end of the bar, and the way he spoke to her was astonishing. He could barley hear her as she was soft spoken while trying to order, and at one point he threw his hand up and said never mind lady. I could not believe it. He gave me his name but I'll keep it to myself as I am not that guy. Poor service and I was ready to walk out before I even received my tea. Will never come here with that type of service. The food was perfect tho so if you feel like being ignored and want to wait 20 mins before your order is taken, then this is the place to come and sit at the bar. Unreal!"
44,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"Ling and Louie's is the best place Eva I don't care wat people say. Food, service and drink are unforgettable their life changing."
45,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"Service is sub par. We weren't greeted upon entry, which is almost always a preview of how your service will be like. Although our server was friendly, he was not very attentive. I looked around at the other tables and it did not appear that servers were checking on their tables. Unless it's a Scottsdale thing where people like to be left alone. 

Three stars is for the food. I want to be fair and the food is pretty good, not great, but worth a try. We ordered beef lo mein, which had the most tender pieces of beef perfectly medium rare; however, the entire dish had the burnt wok taste. Kind of like what it tastes like when the grill needs to be cleaned. The honey walnut shrimp was served on a bed of rice. Clearly the food here is served for individuals rather than family style. We shared everything family style anyway. Lastly we ordered the meatloaf. Not sure how this fits into Asian fusion and it was just okay."
46,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"All the food was excellent, especially the sliders. Our waitress was excellent. We have been here many times and are never disappointed."
47,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"Ling & Louie's is quite alright... nothing that leaves me instantly craving a return trip; but good enough that I'm really glad to have tried it. 

We started off by trying a couple of their appetizers; the crab wontons and the coconut shrimp. Both were pretty tasty and were served with a sweet and tangy tropical sauce that I quite enjoyed. I do wish that the crab wontons would have been a bit crunchier though. For our main dish we split the ""F'n Sliders"" which were these mini burgers loaded with strips of steak. They weren't too bad, but were pretty messy and hard to eat without feeling like a slob. The best thing we had was probably the Tom Kai Gai soup... slightly spicy but very flavorful. This is the type of place that'd probably work a little better with more of a Pei-Wei's type of set up,,, it has more of a casual, almost bar-like atmosphere... it doesn't feel like you're at an Asian restaurant when you're here. 

In the end... it's a cool concept (Asian dishes with more traditional American fusions) it just didn't wow me like it could have. Still it's a solid spot with a fun menu that you should try. 3.5/5."
48,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"I'm surprised this place got such mixed reviews.  I went and all the food we ate was dee-lish.  We took the advice of our wonderful server, Jill (definitely ask for her - she's great!).  She recommended Fire Rock Pale Ale, the Spicy Ahi Tempura Roll, Jewelled Beef Noodles and the Surf and Turf with Vegetable Fried Rice.  Everything was perfectly spiced and sauced; the beef was very tender and veggies were fresh.  It can be a little pricey, but check out their daily specials.  I'll definitely pop in here again!"
49,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"I have been frequently visiting this restaurant for about 10 years now. My favorite dish is the Evil Jungle Princess Chicken & it never disappoints. Houston, Paul, Robbie, & Sherry are all very excellent staff members & Happy Hour Specials are excellent. One of my favorite go to restaurants. I always bring in my out of town guest to Ling and Louie's & they love it."
50,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"Fire the red headed ""Chuck""ie doll he was so awful only came to our table once never refilled our water and took forever to serve us it wasn't even rush hour it was a chill sunday afternoon and we saw his coworkers countless times being so helpful to other customers the food was ok Thai Basil is better and cheaper 
Update: john b i didn't ask u what u thought was necessary"
51,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,Great original concept. Wish there were more & closer. Chicken & rice soup to die for. Great happy hr.
52,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,Friendly atmosphere and waitstaff. Happy hour apps are a great value. Happy Hour drink prices are only ok. Try the crispy calamari...it's excellent!
53,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"I went with a group for lunch on 3/15/18.  Had heard about this place so thought I would try it.

I had the New Wave Pad Thai.  I don't know what was new wave about it.  I have had better pad thai from the frozen section of Trader Joe's.  This place is pricey for the caliber of food you get.

Tried it and won't be back.  I have had much, much better Asian food in the valley."
54,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"Ok, so it isn't excactly Ling's, it's more Louie's. I would describe it as asian inspired with a healthy twist.

This is hands down my favorite lunch spot. They make amazing food, and at great deals. Not to mention it is so conveinently next door to Golden Spoon yogurt. :)

The only down fall is this total creep that works the bar. Mid 50's, greesey pony tail, dangly earring..total weirdo. He is a space invader for sure. I go through a state of panic each time i go with the thought that I could end up in his section. He is one of those who thinks he is 20-something, attractive and funny. He gets down on his knees (so he is at your level sitting) and just joins the conversation. It is really annoying and almost enough to make me avoid the joint."
55,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"I've been here when the food and service is spot on and husband and I love eating here. However, we were very disappointed tonight. Soup was like warm and too salty to eat. Server got the drink order wrong and served brown rice instead of Jasmine. Never checked back. Waited forever to get the check which was wrong. Waited another 15 minutes so we could get it corrected. Asked for the manager who was insincere with his apology and offered a $10 discount on our next visit.  He then came back with a re-adjusted bill and a $25 discount on a future visit. I hope they bring their standards back up."
56,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"This is one of my favorite places to go for many reasons. The food is very unique large portions, many locals sitting at the bar, because bartenders are totally on top of there customers service. Not to mention the patio so cool"
57,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"The Beijing Chicken Nachos are a meal unto themselves. Light crisp won-tons, ground chikcen and bbq sauce. tangy wasabi sour cream. Delicious. 

My review is based on the appetizer the entree was okay could have been more spicy. 

I look forward to going back and trying some other items."
58,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"Very good food! We loved sitting on the patio, it was very dimly lit and relaxing. We enjoyed the potstickers and wine very much! The staff was really attentive as well. I would have liked to try everything on the menu!! Next time :) thank you for a nice evening!"
59,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,"I tried Ling and Louie's this weekend on the recommendation of a friend. I'm not a huge fan of Asian food, so I might have been inclined to go with 3 stars, but my boyfriend really liked it, so I went with 4. 

The restaurant has a good variety of popular dishes from different Asian cuisines. We ordered:

Pork Pot Stickers... slightly crispy on the outside with a good dipping sauce. Overall, not bad. 

Tom Kha Gai soup... coconut based spicy-sweet soup with chicken and mushrooms. The flavor was a little too intense for me. But the bf was a fan. 

New Wave Pad Thai... ordered with out chicken. The shrimp was blackened and good. I liked the sauce a lot. I had one serving with some lime squeezed over it and another with chili paste mixed in. Both were good!

Evil Jungle Princess Beef over Jasmine Rice... I didn't really like my first bite, but as I kept going, I started to like it more and more. What a great mix of flavors!! 

Limeade... I really liked their limeade. Good compliment to the asian food. 

Our waiter was very nice and attentive. Overall, it was a good experience."
60,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,The Emerald Spinach salad is THE best salad I have ever had. And the staff is very helpful and friendly.  Highly recommended!!
61,SBNucLXc9dQP6VBjXOmQ,I'm really surprised that this is 3.5 star. The food is amazing the chicken rice soup is the best I've ever had. They use filet in all of there steak dishes and the price is reasonable. I wish it was closer to my house.
