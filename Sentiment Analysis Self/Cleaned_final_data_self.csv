She never check order, I got idea I ignored, another 25 minutes I simply left. I decided I would give another chance tonight, I went pick order time supposed ready, wasnt ready, I waited another 25 minutes. I asked bartender much longer would be, said I dont know, indication going find out. I asked minutes later much longer would be, pointed Ive waiting long time. She said I could talk manager I wanted, solution offered, I said yes Id like talk manager much. At point spent next 10 minutes waiting customers one task another informing manager I waiting speak him. Unbelievable!!! I finally walked again. Thats last time I walk ridiculously rude restaurant."

4,"Last Sunday first time Asian Grill. All beef dishes made Filet Mignon. My 81 year young Mother ordered Mongolian beef zero complaints! What wonderful concept use tender beef since sliced thin Asian recipes. The entrees served rice instead side. If used rice side accommodate request ordering. For appetizers, spicy calamari hit group five. This served best tasting chili asian slaw. It hit middle schooler too. So Siamese spring rolls served sweet chili sauce. One order appetizers plenty share around table. The miso soup first dark, mild fishy broth...not favorite...must acquired taste. The Sizzling Blackened Chicken Pork cooked red curry butter mild flavor. The meat tender. Try wasabi mashed potatoes extra side dish...yum! The Buddhas Feast Chicken favorite. The menu states hint Thai basil though sauce powered much basil. For lighter diners try combo Ling Chicken Rice soup served Chopstick Chicken salad. The salad dressing sesame soy vinaigrette. We certainly enjoyed food return Ling Louies."

There next time food service rocks. Its hard believe restaurant 3 12 stars Yelp given people showed past Friday. My wife I started rice chicken soup. What surprised hardly rice soup plenty chicken. The soup peppery plus another spice I couldnt put finger on. So soup solid 2.5 3 stars. Now main course, I ordered Kung Pow Beef wife Thai Pad. The Kung Pow Beef consisted filet minon, broccoli, green onions, bell peppers hot peppers rice. I definitely enjoyed dish. My plate piled high delicious food flavorable spicy kick it. I would definitely order dish subsequent visits. My wife enjoyed Thai Pad definitely happy plenty leftovers subsequent lunches. Again, generous portions entree. I cant wait try rest menu, place definitely head shoulders competitors Flos PF Chang food definitely tastes better."

15,"This favorite restaurant Scottsdale. The food exceptionally good fresh full strong flavor. I describe cuisine Americanized Asian food. I like offer option brown rice meals, substitute meats tofu like that. The Evil Jungle Princess absolute favorite. A sweet spicy peanut sauce top chicken, mushrooms, onions, crispy fresh green beens cooked right amount snap bite them. I also love Wango Mango chicken big chunks mango. Everyone always loves New Wave Pad Thai. The Teriyaki Salmon cooked perfection, top bed wasabi mashed potatoes green beens. The Firecracker chicken tastes like wing sauce, like wing sauce like this. Otherwise might want pass. The best part restaurant kids meals. They serve Bento Box, little square compartments portion meal. Its great value comes main dish either noodles chicken wonton chicken, edamame, fried wontons sweet sour sauce, whole large bag MMs, waiter smart enough secretly hand side instead serving rest meal."
16,"I enjoy Asian fusion, disappointing. First, wait 25 minutes seated. Which would fine worth wait... Started cocktali highly recommended waitress. Shanghai Tea something like It nothing special. We ordered Edamame start, never came. I guess someone forgot. Very unfortunately considering hungry were. I orange chicken, okay. It salty,didnt really taste like orange chicken much salt chicken... I wouldnt get again. My husband got Evil Jungle Princess Chicken didnt seem blown away it. I tasted flavorful. Dessert probably best part. We got banana spring roll, pretty tasty. I dont think bother going back."
17,"Loved it! Half expected lame PF Chang wannabe surprised excellent fun was! Specials terrific cheap, bartender Paul made us better drinks Ive town."
18,Worse pei Wei. Thats saying lot. I awhile tried Ling Louies hoping would different. Nope. Food came like mush bland. The honey Walnut shrimp like honey Walmart shrimp. Tastes like microwaved. I two bites wifes evil princess whatever spit out. Even crab rangoons oily. Never again. And comparison sake worse last time.
19,"The first time I ate here, I Firecracker Chicken Tacos Ive addicted ever since. Its I always get. Im usually spicy food, right little spicy, spicy I cant stand it. I think Bleu Cheese gives unique flavor taco, around things good. I also love crab puffs... real crab tons cheese! So, yum! I wish theyd bring back duck flat bread... thing really delicious too. If eat in, prepared I never, ever seen restaurant quiet empty, except right open. Otherwise, hopping theres usually quite people waiting tables... totally worth it. Their outside seating really nice, heaters brief times gets slightly chilly D"
20,"Had dinner yesterday. The staff nice! Houston, Steve, Tanner food consistent always fresh! The Thai Mai killer, still want fav spiced Rum Sailor Jerrys! This great place happy hour, hour! And bring friends!!!!"

24,"Well, one ratings I wish I could give extra 12 star on, 2star deceiving. This place well decorated, personality servers friendly. The problem food. I dont really care good service is, fun atmosphere is, restaurant doesnt good food, categories dont matter. The Pomegranate tea I tasted watered down, Firecracker chicken I highly recommended waitress tasted lot like frozen dinner mildly overdone rice. The sauce bland, chicken dry tasteless. It might pass somebody unfamiliar Asian food. I pretty surprised, shrimp appetizer VERY tasty. Too bad. I dont expect Ill back unless coworkers outnumber me."
25,This place nice. maybe little pricey good time. I recommend it.
26,A great spot Happy Hour! You cant go wrong Tai Mai many Cocktail specials! They also fun apps pair dinner.
27,My wife I love place. It always good food price right. We love pad thai. So flavorsome. The meatloaf great. It great meaty flavor sweet vinegary glaze. For lighter fare try chopped chicken salad. The drinks inventive.
28,"Typical casual dining fake asian food. Five spieces edamame super excited free foursquare check Im cheap asian, cheap anyway especially everlasting happy hour Black orchid ahi really mediocre, soy sauce came gross Evil jungle princess chicken completely overrated, basically huge bowl generic sauce oil dump"

32,"Consistently good; love, love honey walnut shrimp brown rice hold mushrooms, yummy."
33,"I went recently family. Being seated booth, I say first impression place great. Its never good thing restaurant booths set claustrophobiainducing style, tables seats crammed together tabletop way close body. I followed Yelp app announcement signed email list order get free lettuce wrap appetizer, decent. For entree I ordered Evil Jungle Princess shrimp fried rice. It sounded really tasty menu, dish ended bland, seemed kind of... mushy overcooked. It wasnt worst thing Ive ever eaten, I would order again. Our server seemed friendly wasnt attentive. My mom waiting get water glass refilled quite while, ended flagging different server. Overall impressed place."
34,I eat here. Because service poor. I went bar. Sat 5 10 min. The persons behind bar. Wakes back fourth front 4 times never said word. Than went back end bar grab bill. Waked back across front went check table still greeting anything. I left went stone vine food service fantastic. At 6ft 200lb first time I felt invisible.
35,"When looking new place try I always try scope menu going. The menu Ling Louies awesome looking items it. When first entered restaurant employees around greet us. It initially confusing whether seat wait hosthostess. Finally someone walked greeted us took us seats. The server pleasant explained restaurant well. We ended ordering handwrapped potstickers, lettuce wraps, new wave pad thai, miso soup. I also gingerlime margarita 22oz Lings lager. The food EXTREMELY disappointing. The potstickers far best items ordered. The lettuce wraps lettuce pad thai tasted strongly GAS wok difficult swallow. The pad thai lacking flavor spice overpowered gas wok flavors may unnoticeable. This goes lettuce wraps well; lettuce use fine, however chicken mix wokd gassy tasting wife struggled finish well. The miso soup equally terrible full thin stringed seaweed. Miso soup seaweed liquid. It awful. To top off, I ordered 22oz lager hopes something wash gas aftertaste suffering through. I received beer 16 MINUTES ordering it, bar NOT busy, Wednesday night. That unacceptable. Drinks quickest easiest thing get customers. This restaurant receives 2 stars good potstickers, good margarita, subpar overall service, lackluster food. If like wokd food tasting primarily like GAS place you! Just us.."
36,A favorite birthdays special occasions. The Evil Jungle Princess Beef go dish!
37,"Classic case good thing going south... something like that. Always great food, time cant get execution down. Service slips seemingly every visit. Gotta get right."

39,Cool little spot right little shopping center nice restaurants bars. They Asian fusion food interesting drinks appetizers. good happy hour.
40,"First let state reason I deducting star I didnt like entree I ordered, due fact quality food great I would return try different entree menu. I also really enjoyed lettuce wraps, would bring back again. The service amazing! Our waitress, I believe name Ashley cute blonde girl fantastic job! She professional, knowledgeable, personable. The manager also great... He came see everything was, gave us coupon invited us back. The atmosphere modern, cute, laid back fun. I really enjoyed experience I stated previously, I would return try something different menu!"
41,Place line door. Which tells something. Their soap salads scrumptious. Portion sizes enough leftovers. Pricing reasonable excellent quality. Highly recommend.
42,"My friend I went Friday night dinner. Its one favorite restaurants, I never before. We sat outside, trouble getting table. I ordered Korean Salmon came sizzling asparagus underneath it. The salmon cooked perfectly!!! I impressed! And, delicious! I asked brown rice it, I would recommend doing. It great evening great meal!"
43,"I wanna steal manager TV time chef restaurant ; The bathrooms awesome clean, one REALLY knows restaurant good. Great food, big smiles, sumptuous drinks...what ask"
44,"Im giving 2 stars kids menu, good compared others seen. But comes regular menu I disappointed tonight. In past, I would given Ling Louies 3.54 stars, always pretty good satisfying meal. However, changed menu since last time I dont know means things changed kitchen!! We started appetizer featured Vietnam menu, Summer Rolls 10.95, I feel worth 3.95 grocery store cold bar 34 small pieces shrimp veggies, bland, sauce served next added nothing unfortunately. I ordered Cashew Chicken Stir Fry husband Mongolian Chicken. I felt like something I could ordered fast good Chinese restaurant, terrible, I would expected Ling Louies went husband. Not experienced past here. Bottom line, food mediocre best sure prices back disappointing since used one go places Asian cuisine pleased everyone. We defiantly dont mind spending good cuisine would rather drive little spend elsewhere."
45,"Went yesterday lunch, arrived 1145ish sat bar. There two others sitting I arrived. I sat 15 mins bar tender even greet me. I get menu wall right walk in, way I knew I saw 4 parties get sat thats servers pulling menus. I finally acknowledged I menus. I asked Iced tea, looked like I bothering asking. Again another 5 mins I received tea. He busy dealing take orders, seating people walked in. It another 5 mins place order I looked said I drank tea quickly. Who says To top lady walked moments I received food sat end bar, way spoke astonishing. He could barley hear soft spoken trying order, one point threw hand said never mind lady. I could believe it. He gave name Ill keep I guy. Poor service I ready walk I even received tea. Will never come type service. The food perfect tho feel like ignored want wait 20 mins order taken, place come sit bar. Unreal!"
46,"Ling Louies best place Eva I dont care wat people say. Food, service drink unforgettable life changing."
47,"Service sub par. We werent greeted upon entry, almost always preview service like. Although server friendly, attentive. I looked around tables appear servers checking tables. Unless Scottsdale thing people like left alone. Three stars food. I want fair food pretty good, great, worth try. We ordered beef lo mein, tender pieces beef perfectly medium rare; however, entire dish burnt wok taste. Kind like tastes like grill needs cleaned. The honey walnut shrimp served bed rice. Clearly food served individuals rather family style. We shared everything family style anyway. Lastly ordered meatloaf. Not sure fits Asian fusion okay."
48,"All food excellent, especially sliders. Our waitress excellent. We many times never disappointed."
49,"Ling Louies quite alright... nothing leaves instantly craving return trip; good enough Im really glad tried it. We started trying couple appetizers; crab wontons coconut shrimp. Both pretty tasty served sweet tangy tropical sauce I quite enjoyed. I wish crab wontons would bit crunchier though. For main dish split Fn Sliders mini burgers loaded strips steak. They werent bad, pretty messy hard eat without feeling like slob. The best thing probably Tom Kai Gai soup... slightly spicy flavorful. This type place thatd probably work little better PeiWeis type set up,,, casual, almost barlike atmosphere... doesnt feel like youre Asian restaurant youre here. In end... cool concept Asian dishes traditional American fusions didnt wow like could have. Still solid spot fun menu try. 3.55."
50,"Im surprised place got mixed reviews. I went food ate deelish. We took advice wonderful server, Jill definitely ask shes great!. She recommended Fire Rock Pale Ale, Spicy Ahi Tempura Roll, Jewelled Beef Noodles Surf Turf Vegetable Fried Rice. Everything perfectly spiced sauced; beef tender veggies fresh. It little pricey, check daily specials. Ill definitely pop again!"
51,"I frequently visiting restaurant 10 years now. My favorite dish Evil Jungle Princess Chicken never disappoints. Houston, Paul, Robbie, Sherry excellent staff members Happy Hour Specials excellent. One favorite go restaurants. I always bring town guest Ling Louies love it."

56,"Ok, isnt excactly Lings, Louies. I would describe asian inspired healthy twist. This hands favorite lunch spot. They make amazing food, great deals. Not mention conveinently next door Golden Spoon yogurt. The fall total creep works bar. Mid 50s, greesey pony tail, dangly earring..total weirdo. He space invader sure.
